# ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree interpreter 

This repository contains implementations of ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree
Interpreter for a family of Sigma-protocol based authentication languages (or simply
Sigma language).

This library is used internally in [Ergo
Node](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo) and
[ergo-wallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/tree/master/ergo-wallet), the
public interfaces are subject to change.

For development of Ergo applications using JVM languages (Java/Scala/Kotlin/etc)
a better alternative is to use
[Appkit](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit).

The library is cross-compiled to JS using Scala.js and the main abstractions can be used
from JS directly by importing [NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sigmastate-js).
See [README](sigma-js/README.md) for details.

## Sigma Language Background

Every coin in Bitcoin is protected by a program in the stack-based Script
language. An interpreter for the language is evaluating the program against a
context (few variables containing information about a spending transaction and
the blockchain), producing a single boolean value as a result. While Bitcoin
Script allows for some contracts to be programmed, its abilities are limited.
Also, to add new cryptographic primitives, for example, ring signatures, a
hard-fork is required.

Generalizing the Bitcoin Script, ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree interpreter
implement an _authentication language_ which allows to express coin spending
conditions. The [ErgoScript
Compiler](sigmastate/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/SigmaCompiler.scala#L48)
compiles the source code into
[ErgoTree](sigmastate/src/main/scala/sigmastate/Values.scala#L990) byte code,
which can be saved in UTXO coins to protect their spending (same as in Bitcoin).

ErgoTree, in turn, is a bytecode language and memory representation which can be
deterministically interpreted in the given _blockchain context_. 
ErgoTree defines guarding proposition for a coin as a logic formula which
combines predicates over a context and cryptographic statements provable via
[Σ-protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_knowledge#Sigma_protocols)
with AND, OR, k-out-of-n connectives.

An _interacting party_ willing to spend the coin first constructs a
[prover](sigmastate/src/main/scala/sigmastate/interpreter/ProverInterpreter.scala)
with a set of secrets it knows and then the prover is executed in two steps:

- _Reduction_ - the prover uses the ErgoTree interpreter and deterministically
reduces the ErgoTree proposition to a compound _cryptographic statement_(aka
sigma proposition, Σ-protocol) by evaluating ErgoTree over known shared context
(state of the blockchain system and a spending transaction). This step produces
a value of the [SigmaBoolean](sigmastate/src/main/scala/sigmastate/Values.scala)
type.

- Signing - the prover is turning the obtained (and possibly
complex) Σ-proposition into a signature with the help of a [Fiat-Shamir
transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat-Shamir_heuristic). This step
produces a _proof_ that the party knows the secrets such that the knowledge can
be verified before the spending transaction is added to the blockchain.

To allow valid coin spending a
[verifier](sigmastate/src/main/scala/sigmastate/interpreter/Interpreter.scala)
is running the ErgoTree interpreter with the following three inputs:
- a guarding proposition given by an ErgoTree 
- a blockchain _context_ of the transaction being verified
- a _proof_ (aka transaction signature) generated by a _prover_ 
 
The verifier is executed as part of transaction validation for each input and is
executed in tree steps:

- _Reduction_ - same as prover, the verifier uses the ErgoTree interpreter and
deterministically produces a value of the
[SigmaBoolean](sigmastate/src/main/scala/sigmastate/Values.scala) type. 
However, this step must finish evaluation for any possible inputs within
concrete fixed time limit (aka maximum cost), which is checked by the interpreter.

- Cost estimation - the verifier estimates the complexity of cryptographic Sigma
proposition (based in the size and the concrete nodes of SigmaBoolean tree). The
spending fails if the estimated cost exceeds the maximum limit.

- Signature verification - the signature checker takes 1) the proof, 2) the
SigmaBoolean (aka [sigma
protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_knowledge#Sigma_protocols)
proposition) and 3) the signed message (e.g. transaction bytes).
The checker than verifies the proof, which means it verifies that all the
necessary secrets has been known and used to construct the proof (i.e. sign the
transaction).

## Getting Started 

This library is
[publishied](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scorexfoundation/sigma-state)
on Maven repository and can be added to the SBT configuration of Scala project.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scorexfoundation" %% "sigma-state" % "6.0.0"
```
