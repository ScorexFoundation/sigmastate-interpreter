# ErgoScript Language Description

### Introduction

ErgoScript is a language to write contracts for [Ergo
blockchain](https://ergoplatform.org). ErgoScript contracts can be compiled to
[ErgoTrees](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf), serialized and stored
in UTXOs.

A good starting point to writing contracts is to use [ErgoScript by
Example](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example) with [Ergo
Playgrounds](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-playgrounds) or
[Appkit](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit).

ErgoScript compiler is
[published](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scorexfoundation/sigma-state)
as a library which is cross compiled for Java 7 and Java 8+ and thus can be used
from any JVM lanugage and also on Android and JavaFX platforms.

The following example shows how source code of ErgoScript contract can be used
to create new transaction using
[Appkit](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit), see [full
example](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit-examples/blob/master/java-examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/examples/FreezeCoin.java)
for details.

```java
// To create transaction we use a builder obtained from the context
// the builder keeps relationship with the context to access necessary blockchain data.
UnsignedTransactionBuilder txB = ctx.newTxBuilder();

// create new box using new builder obtained from the transaction builder
// in this case we compile new ErgoContract from source ErgoScript code
OutBox newBox = txB.outBoxBuilder()
        .value(amountToPay)
        .contract(ctx.compileContract(
                ConstantsBuilder.create()
                        .item("freezeDeadline", ctx.getHeight() + newBoxDelay)
                        .item("pkOwner", prover.getP2PKAddress().pubkey())
                        .build(),
                "{ " +
                "  val deadlinePassed = sigmaProp(HEIGHT > freezeDeadline)" +
                "  deadlinePassed && pkOwner " +
                "}"))
        .build();
```

The contract is given as the string literal which contains the block of `val`
declarations followed by the logical expression. The expression defines the all
possible conditions to spend the box. The contract can also contain _named
constants_ (which cannot be represented as literals in the source code). 
In the example `freezeDeadline` and `pkOwner` are named constants. The concrete
values of named constants should be given to the compiler (see `compileContract`
method)

The following sections describe ErgoScript and its operations. 

#### ErgoScript language features overview

- syntax borrowed from Scala
- standard syntax and semantics for well known constructs (operations, code blocks, if branches etc.)
- high-order language with first-class lambdas which are used in collection operations
- call-by-value (eager evaluation)
- statically typed with local type inference
- blocks are expressions 
- semicolon inference in blocks
- type constructors: Pair, Coll, Option

#### Operations and constructs overview

- Binary operations: `>, <, >=, <=, +, -, &&, ||, ==, !=, |, &, *, /, %, ^, ++`
- predefined primitives: `serialize`, `deserializeTo`, `blake2b256`, `byteArrayToBigInt`, `proveDlog` etc. 
- val declarations: `val h = blake2b256(pubkey)`
- if-then-else clause: `if (x > 0) 1 else 0`
- collection literals: `Coll(1, 2, 3, 4)`
- generic high-order collection operations: `map`, `filter`, `fold`, `exists`, `forall`, etc.
- accessing fields of any predefined types: `box.value`
- method invocation for predefined types: `coll.map({ x => x + 1 })`
- function invocations (predefined and user defined): `proveDlog(pubkey)` 
- user defined function declarations: `def isProven(pk: GroupElement) = proveDlog(pk).isProven`
- lambdas and high-order methods: `OUTPUTS.exists { (out: Box) => out.value >= minToRaise }`

#### Data types 

In ErgoScript, everything is an object in the sense that we can call member functions and properties on any variable.
Some of the types can have a special internal representation - for example, numbers and booleans can be
represented as primitive values at runtime - but to the user they look like ordinary classes.
NOTE: in ErgoScript we use *type*, *class* and *trait* as synonyms, we prefer *type* when talking about primitive values and
*trait* or *class* when talking about methods.

Type Name        |   Description
-----------------|------------------------------
`Any`            | a supertype of any other type (not used directly in ErgoScript)
`Unit`           | a type with a single value `()`
`Boolean`        | a type with two logical values `true` and `false`
`Byte`           | 8 bit signed integer
`Short`          | 16 bit signed integer
`Int`            | 32 bit signed integer
`Long`           | 64 bit signed integer
`BigInt`         | 256 bit signed integer
`SigmaProp`      | a type representing a _sigma proposition_ which can be verified by executing a Sigma protocol with zero-knowledge proof of knowledge. Every contract should return a value of this type.
`AvlTree`        | represents a digest of authenticated dynamic dictionary and can be used to verify proofs of operations performed on the dictionary
`GroupElement`   | elliptic curve points
`Box`            | a box containing a monetary value (in NanoErgs), tokens and registers along with a guarding proposition
`Option[T]`      | a container which either have some value of type `T` or none.
`Coll[T]`        | a collection of arbitrary length with all values of type `T` 
`(T1,T2)`        | a pair of values where T1, T2 can be different types

The type constructors `Coll`, `(_,_)` can be used to construct complex
types as in the following example.
```scala
{
  val keyValues = OUTPUTS(0).R4[Coll[(Int, (Byte, Long))]].get
  ...
}
```

#### Literal syntax and Constants

Literals are used to introduce values of some types directly in program text
like in the following example:
```
 val unit: Unit = ()       // unit constant
 val long: Int = 10        // interger value literal
 val bool: Boolean = true  // logical literal
 val arr = Coll(1, 2, 3)   // constructs a collection with given items
 val str = "abc"           // string of characters 
```
Note that many types don't have literal syntax and their values are introduced 
by applying operations, for example `deserialize` function can be used to introduce
a constant of any type by using Base64 encoded string (See [predefined function](#PredefinedFunctions)).

### Data Types
<a name="DataTypes"></a>

#### Primitive Types

Below we specify methods of pre-defined types using Scala-like declaration of
classes. Note, the `Boolean` type doesn't have pre-defined methods in addition
to the standard operations.

Note, ErgoScript doesn't allow to define new `class` types, however it has many
pre-defined classes with methods defined below.

Every numeric type has the following methods.
```scala
/** Base supertype for all numeric types. */
class Numeric {
  /** Convert this Numeric value to Byte. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   */
  def toByte: Byte
  
  /** Convert this Numeric value to Short. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   */
  def toShort: Short
  
  /** Convert this Numeric value to Int. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   */
  def toInt: Int
  
  /** Convert this Numeric value to Long. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   */
  def toLong: Long
  
  /** Convert this Numeric value to BigInt. */
  def toBigInt: BigInt
}
```

All the predefined numeric types inherit Numeric class and its methods.
They can be thought as being pre-defined like the following.

```scala 
class Byte extends Numeric
class Short extends Numeric
class Int extends Numeric
class Long extends Numeric
class BigInt extends Numeric
```

#### Context Data 

Every script is executed in a context, which is a collection of data available
for operations in the script. The context data is available using the `CONTEXT`
variable which is of pre-defined class `Context` which is shown below. 

There are also shortcut variables which are available in every script to
simplify access to the most commonly used context data.

Variable          |  Type               | Shortcut for ...
------------------|---------------------|----------------------
`HEIGHT`          | `Int`               | `CONTEXT.HEIGHT`
`SELF`            | `Box`               | `CONTEXT.SELF` 
`INPUTS`          | `Coll[Box]`         | `CONTEXT.INPUTS`  
`OUTPUTS`         | `Coll[Box]`         | `CONTEXT.OUTPUTS` 

The following listing shows the methods of pre-defined `Context`, `Header`,
`PreHeader` types.

```scala
/** Represents data available in ErgoScript using `CONTEXT` global variable */
class Context {
  /** Height (block number) of the block which is currently being validated. */
  def HEIGHT: Int
  
  /** Box whose proposition is being currently executing */
  def SELF: Box

  /** Zero based index in `inputs` of `selfBox` */
  def selfBoxIndex: Int

  /** A collection of inputs of the current transaction, the transaction where
    * selfBox is one of the inputs. 
    */
  def INPUTS: Coll[Box]
  
  /** A collection of data inputs of the current transaction. Data inputs are
    * not going to be spent and thus don't participate in transaction validation
    * as `INPUTS`, but data boxes are available in guarding propositions of
    * `INPUTS` and thus can be used in spending logic.
    */
  def dataInputs: Coll[Box]
  
  /** A collection of outputs of the current transaction. */
  def OUTPUTS: Coll[Box]
  
  /** Authenticated dynamic dictionary digest representing Utxo state before
    * current state. 
    */
  def LastBlockUtxoRootHash: AvlTree
  
  /** A fixed number of last block headers in descending order (first header is
    * the newest one) 
    */
  def headers: Coll[Header]

  /** Header fields that are known before the block is mined. */
  def preHeader: PreHeader

  /** Bytes of encoded miner's public key. 
    * Same as `preHeader.minerPk.getEncoded`
    */
  def minerPubKey: Coll[Byte]

}

/** Represents data of the block headers available in scripts. */
class Header {  

  /** Validate header's proof-of-work */  
  def checkPow: Boolean
  
  /** Bytes representation of ModifierId of this Header */
  def id: Coll[Byte]

  /** Block version, to be increased on every soft and hardfork. */
  def version: Byte
  
  /** Id of parent block (as bytes) */
  def parentId: Coll[Byte] // 
  
  /** Hash of ADProofs for transactions in a block */
  def ADProofsRoot: Coll[Byte] // Digest32. Can we build AvlTree out of it? 

  /** AvlTree) of a state after block application */
  def stateRoot: Coll[Byte]  // ADDigest  //33 bytes! extra byte with tree height here!

  /** Root hash (for a Merkle tree) of transactions in a block. */
  def transactionsRoot: Coll[Byte]  // Digest32

  /** Block timestamp (in milliseconds since beginning of Unix Epoch) */
  def timestamp: Long

  /** Current difficulty in a compressed view.
    * NOTE: actually it is unsigned Int*/
  def nBits: Long  // actually it is unsigned Int 

  /** Block height */
  def height: Int

  /** Root hash of extension section (Digest32) */
  def extensionRoot: Coll[Byte]

  /** Miner public key. Should be used to collect block rewards.
    * Part of Autolykos solution (pk). 
    */
  def minerPk: GroupElement

  /** One-time public key. Prevents revealing of miners secret. 
    * Part of Autolykos solution (w). 
    */
  def powOnetimePk: GroupElement

  /** Nonce value found by the miner. Part of Autolykos solution (n). */
  def powNonce: Coll[Byte]

  /** Distance between pseudo-random number, corresponding to nonce `powNonce`
    * and a secret, corresponding to `minerPk`. The lower `powDistance` is, the
    * harder it was to find this solution. 
    * Part of Autolykos solution (d).
    */
  def powDistance: BigInt

  /** Miner votes for changing system parameters. */
  def votes: Coll[Byte]
}

/** Only header fields that can be predicted by a miner. */
class PreHeader { 
  /** Block version, to be increased on every soft and hardfork. */
  def version: Byte

  /** Id of parent block */
  def parentId: Coll[Byte] // ModifierId

  /** Block timestamp (in milliseconds since beginning of Unix Epoch) */
  def timestamp: Long

  /** Current difficulty in a compressed view.
    * NOTE: actually it is 32-bit unsigned Int */
  def nBits: Long

  /** Block height */
  def height: Int

  /** Miner's public key. Should be used to collect block rewards. */
  def minerPk: GroupElement

  /** Miner votes for changing system parameters. */
  def votes: Coll[Byte]
}

```

#### Box type

Box represents a unit of storage in Ergo blockchain. It contains 10 registers
(indexed 0-9). First 4 are mandatory and the others are optional.

```scala
/** Representation of Ergo boxes used during execution of ErgoTree operations. */
class Box {
  /** Box monetary value in NanoErg */
  def value: Long 
  
  /** Blake2b256 hash of this box's content, basically equals to
    * `blake2b256(bytes)` 
    */
  def id: Coll[Byte] 

  /** Serialized bytes of guarding script, which should be evaluated to true in
    * order to open this box. 
    */
  def propositionBytes: Coll[Byte] 
  
  /** Serialized bytes of this box's content, including proposition bytes. */
  def bytes: Coll[Byte] 
  
  /** Serialized bytes of this box's content, excluding transactionId and index
    * of output. 
    */
  def bytesWithoutRef: Coll[Byte]
    
  /** If `tx` is a transaction which generated this box, then `creationInfo._1`
    * is a height of the tx's block. The `creationInfo._2` is a serialized
    * transaction identifier followed by box index in the transaction outputs.
    */
  def creationInfo: (Int, Coll[Byte]) 
  
  /** Synonym of R2 obligatory register */
  def tokens: Coll[(Coll[Byte], Long)] 
  
  /** Extracts register by id and type.
    * ErgoScript is typed, so accessing a register is an operation which involves some
    * expected type given in brackets. Thus `SELF.R4[Int]` expression should evaluate to a
    * valid value of the `Option[Int]` type.
    *
    * For example `val x = SELF.R4[Int]` expects the
    * register, if it is present, to have type `Int`. At runtime the corresponding type
    * descriptor is passed as `implicit t: RType[T]` parameter of `getReg` method and
    * checked against the actual value of the register.
    *
    * There are three cases:
    * 1) If the register doesn't exist.
    *   Then `val x = SELF.R4[Int]` succeeds and returns the None value, which conforms to
    *   any value of type `Option[T]` for any T. (In the example above T is equal to
    *   `Int`). Calling `x.get` fails when x is equal to None, but `x.isDefined`
    *   succeeds and returns `false`.
    * 2) If the register contains a value `v` of type `Int`.
    *   Then `val x = SELF.R4[Int]` succeeds and returns `Some(v)`, which is a valid value
    *   of type `Option[Int]`. In this case, calling `x.get` succeeds and returns the
    *   value `v` of type `Int`. Calling `x.isDefined` returns `true`.
    * 3) If the register contains a value `v` of type T other then `Int`.
    *   Then `val x = SELF.R4[Int]` fails, because there is no way to return a valid value
    *   of type `Option[Int]`. The value of register is present, so returning it as None
    *   would break the typed semantics of registers collection.
    *
    * In some use cases one register may have values of different types. To access such
    * register an additional register can be used as a tag.
    *
    * <pre class="stHighlight">
    *   val tagOpt = SELF.R5[Int]
    *   val res = if (tagOpt.isDefined) {
    *     val tag = tagOpt.get
    *     if (tag == 1) {
    *       val x = SELF.R4[Int].get
    *       // compute res using value x is of type Int
    *     } else if (tag == 2) {
    *       val x = SELF.R4[GroupElement].get
    *       // compute res using value x is of type GroupElement
    *     } else if (tag == 3) {
    *       val x = SELF.R4[ Array[Byte] ].get
    *       // compute res using value x of type Array[Byte]
    *     } else {
    *       // compute `res` when `tag` is not 1, 2 or 3
    *     }
    *   }
    *   else {
    *     // compute value of res when register is not present
    *   }
    * </pre>
    *
    * @param i zero-based identifier of the register.
    * @tparam T expected type of the register.
    * @return Some(value) if the register is defined AND has the given type.
    *         None otherwise
    * @throws InvalidType exception when the type of the register value is
    *                                   different from T.
    */
  def Ri[T]: Option[T]
}
```

Besides properties, every box can have up to 10 numbered registers.
The following syntax is supported to access registers on box objects:
```
// access R3 register, check that its value of type Int and return it
box.R3[Int].get         
 
// check that value of R3 is defined and has type Int
box.R3[Int].isDefined    

// access R3 register, if it is defined and of type Int then return it, 
// if not of type Int then throw exception, 
// if not defined then return `d`
box.R3[Int].getOrElse(d) 
```

#### GroupElement
```scala
/** Base class for points on elliptic curves. */
class GroupElement {
  /** Exponentiate this <code>GroupElement</code> to the given number.
    * @param k The power.
    * @return <code>this to the power of k</code>.
    */
  def exp(k: BigInt): GroupElement

  /** Group operation. */
  def multiply(that: GroupElement): GroupElement

  /** Inverse element in the group. */
  def negate: GroupElement

  /** Get an encoding of the point value.
    *
    * @return the point encoding
    */
  def getEncoded: Coll[Byte]
}
```

#### SigmaProp
```scala
/** Proposition which can be proven and verified by sigma protocol. */
trait SigmaProp {
  /** Serialized bytes of this sigma proposition.
    * In order to have comparisons like  `box.propositionBytes == prop.propBytes`
    * this SigmaProp is converted to ErgoTree as:
    * 1. prop converted to [[SigmaPropConstant]]
    * 2. new ErgoTree created with with ErgoTree.DefaultHeader, EmptyConstant and SigmaPropConstant as the root
    * 
    * Thus obtained ErgoTree is serialized using DefaultSerializer and compared with `box.propositionBytes`.
    * Here, propBytes uses very specific ErgoTree with header == 0, and hence ErgoTree.version == 0.
    * However, `box.propositionBytes`, contain bytes of ErgoTree from `box`, and version of that
    * tree depends on how the `box` was created.
    * A better way to compare `box.propositionBytes` and `prop.propBytes` is to use the following code:
    * ```
    * val propBytes = prop.propBytes
    * val treeBytes = box.propositionBytes
    * if (treeBytes(0) == 0) {
    *   treeBytes == propBytes
    * } else {
    *   // offset = 1 + <number of VLQ encoded bytes to store propositionBytes.size>
    *   val offset = if (propositionBytes.size > 127) 3 else 2
    *   propBytes.slice(1, propBytes.size) == propositionBytes.slice(offset, propositionBytes.size) 
    * }
    * ```
    */
  def propBytes: Coll[Byte]

  /** Logical AND between this SigmaProp and the `other` SigmaProp.
    * This constructs a new CAND node of a sigma tree with two children. */
  def &&(other: SigmaProp): SigmaProp

  /** Logical AND between this `SigmaProp` and the `Boolean` value on the right.
    * The boolean value will be wrapped into `SigmaProp` using the `sigmaProp` function.
    * This constructs a new CAND node of a sigma tree with two children. */
  def &&(other: Boolean): SigmaProp

  /** Logical OR between this SigmaProp and the other SigmaProp.
    * This constructs a new COR node of sigma tree with two children. */
  def ||(other: SigmaProp): SigmaProp

  /** Logical OR between this `SigmaProp` and the `Boolean` value on the right.
    * The boolean value will be wrapped into `SigmaProp` using the `sigmaProp` function.
    * This constructs a new COR node of a sigma tree with two children. */
  def ||(other: Boolean): SigmaProp
}
```

#### AvlTree

```scala
/** Type of data which efficiently authenticates potentially huge dataset having key-value dictionary interface.
  * Only root hash of dynamic AVL+ tree, tree height, key length, optional value length, and access flags are stored
  * in an instance of the datatype.
  *
  * Please note that standard hash function from `scorex.crypto.hash` is used, and height is stored along with root hash of
  * the tree, thus `digest` size is always CryptoConstants.hashLength + 1 bytes.

Each item can be accessed by constant index, for example:
```
val myOutput = OUTPUTS(0)
val myInput = INPUTS(0)
```

Any collection have the `size` property which returns the number of elements in
the collection.

```
val size = OUTPUTS.size
```

The following script check an existence of some element in the collection
satisfying some predicate (condition)

```
val ok = OUTPUTS.exists { (box: Box) => box.value > 1000 }
```

ErgoScript standard library include predefined functions that can be called 
without prior declaration. 

The following function declarations are automatically imported into any script:

```scala

/** Returns true if at least on element of the conditions is true */

 * if at least k properties can be proven to be true. 
 */
def atLeast(k: Int, properties: Coll[SigmaProp]): SigmaProp

 * operation allows boolean expressions to be used as arguments of
 * `atLeast(..., sigmaProp(myCondition), ...)` operation.

/** Extracts Context variable by id and type.
  * ErgoScript is typed, so accessing a the variables is an operation which involves
  * some expected type given in brackets. Thus `getVar[Int](id)` expression should
  * evaluate to a valid value of the `Option[Int]` type.
  *
  * For example `val x = getVar[Int](10)` expects the variable, if it is present, to have
  * type `Int`. 
  *
  * There are three cases:
  * 1) If the variable doesn't exist.
  *   Then `val x = getVar[Int](id)` succeeds and returns the None value, which conforms to
  *   any value of type `Option[T]` for any T. (In the example above T is equal to
  *   `Int`). Calling `x.get` fails when x is equal to None, but `x.isDefined`
  *   succeeds and returns `false`.
  * 2) If the variable contains a value `v` of type `Int`.
  *   Then `val x = getVar[Int](id)` succeeds and returns `Some(v)`, which is a valid value
  *   of type `Option[Int]`. In this case, calling `x.get` succeeds and returns the
  *   value `v` of type `Int`. Calling `x.isDefined` returns `true`.
  * 3) If the variable contains a value `v` of type T other then `Int`.
  *   Then `val x = getVar[Int](id)` fails, because there is no way to return a valid value
  *   of type `Option[Int]`. The value of variable is present, so returning it as None
  *   would break the typed semantics of variables collection.
  *
  * In some use cases one variable may have values of different types. To access such
  * variable an additional variable can be used as a tag.
  *
  * <pre class="stHighlight">
  *   val tagOpt = getVar[Int](id)
  *   val res = if (tagOpt.isDefined) {
  *     val tag = tagOpt.get
  *     if (tag == 1) {
  *       val x = getVar[Int](id2).get
  *       // compute res when value x is of type Int
  *     } else if (tag == 2) {
  *       val x = getVar[GroupElement](id2).get
  *       // compute res when value x is of type GroupElement
  *     } else if (tag == 3) {
  *       val x = getVar[ Array[Byte] ](id2).get
  *       // compute res when value x of type Array[Byte]
  *     } else {
  *       // compute `res` when `tag` is not 1, 2 or 3
  *     }
  *   }
  *   else {
  *     // compute value of res when the variable is not present
  *   }
  * </pre>
  *
  * @param id zero-based identifier of the variable.
  * @tparam T expected type of the variable.
  * @return Some(value) if the variable is defined in the context AND has the given type.
  *         None otherwise
  * @throws InvalidType exception when the type of the variable value is
