# ErgoScript Language Description

### Introduction

#### ErgoScript language features

- syntax borrowed from Scala and Kotlin
- standard syntax and semantics for well known constructs (operations, code blocks, if branches etc.)
- high-order with first-class lambdas that are used in collection operations
- call-by-value (eager evaluation)
- statically typed with local type inference
- blocks are expressions 
- semicolon inference in blocks
- type constructors: Tuple, Coll, Option

#### Operations and constructs

- Binary operations: `>, <, >=, <=, +, -, &&, ||, ==, !=, |, *, ^, ++`
- predefined primitives: `blake2b256`, `byteArrayToBigInt`, `proveDlog` etc. 
- val declarations: `val h = blake2b256(pubkey)`
- if-then-else clause: `if (x > 0) 1 else 0`
- collection literals: `Col(1, 2, 3, 4)`
- generic high-order collection operations: `map`, `fold`, `exists`, `forall`, etc.
- accessing fields of any predefined structured objects: `box.value`
- function invocations (predefined and user defined): `proveDlog(pubkey)` 
- user defined functions: `def isProven(pk: GroupElement) = proveDlog(pk).isProven`
- lambdas and high-order methods: `OUTPUTS.exists { (out: Box) => out.value >= minToRaise }`

#### Data types 

In ErgoScript, everything is an object in the sense that we can call member functions and properties on any variable.
Some of the types can have a special internal representation - for example, numbers and booleans can be
represented as primitive values at runtime - but to the user they look like ordinary classes.
NOTE: in ErgoScript we use *type* and *class* as synonyms, we prefer *type* when talking about primitive values and
*class* when talking about methods.

Type Name        |   Description
-----------------|------------------------------
`Any`            | a supertype of any other type
`Unit`           | a type with a single value `()`
`Boolean`        | a type with two logical values `true` and `false`
`Byte`           | 8 bit signed integer
`Short`          | 16 bit signed integer
`Int`            | 32 bit signed integer
`Long`           | 64 bit signed integer
`BigInt`         | 256 bit signed integer
`SigmaProp`      | a type which represent a logical value which can be be obtained by executing a Sigma protocol with zero-knowledge proof of knowledge
`AvlTree`        | authenticated dynamic dictionary
`GroupElement`   | elliptic curve points
`Box`            | a box containing a value, tokens and registers along with a guarding proposition
`Option[T]`      | a container which either have some value of type `T` or none.
`Coll[T]`        | a collection of arbitrary length with all values of type `T` 
`(T1,...,Tn)`    | tuples, a collection of element where T1, ..., Tn can be different types

#### Literal syntax and Constants

Literals are used to introduce values of some types directly in program text like the following examples:
```
 val unit: Unit = ()       // unit constant
 val long: Int = 10        // interger value literal
 val bool: Boolean = true  // logical literal
 val arr = Coll(1, 2, 3)   // constructs a collection with given items
 val str = "abc"           // string of characters 
```
Note that many types don't have literal syntax and their values are introduced 
by applying operations, for example `deserialize` function can be used to introduce
a constant of any type by using Base64 encoded string (See [predefined function](#PredefinedFunctions)).

#### Primitive Types

```scala
class Boolean {
  /** Convert true to 1 and false to 0
   * @since 2.0
   */
  def toByte: Byte
}

/** Base supertype for all numeric types. */
class Numeric {
  /** Convert this Numeric value to Byte. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   */
  def toByte: Byte

   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   */
  def toShort: Short
  
  /** Convert this Numeric value to Int. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   */
  def toInt: Int
  
  /** Convert this Numeric value to Int. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   */
  def toLong: Long
  
  /** Convert this Numeric value to Int. */
  def toBigInt: BigInt
  
  /** Returns a big-endian representation of this numeric in a collection of bytes.
   * For example, the long value {@code 0x1213141516171819L} would yield the
   * byte array {@code {0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16, 0x17, 0x18, 0x19}}.
   * @since 2.0
   */ 
  def toBytes: Coll[Byte]
  
  /** Returns a big-endian representation of this numeric in a collection of Booleans.
   * Each boolean corresponds to one bit.
   * @since 2.0
   */ 
  def toBits: Coll[Boolean] 
  
   /** Absolute value of this numeric value. 
    * @since 2.0
    */  
  def abs: Numeric 
  
  /** Compares this numeric with that numeric for order.  Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the
   * `this` is less than, equal to, or greater than `that`.
   */
  def compare(that: SNumeric): Int 
}

class Short extends Numeric
class Int extends Numeric
class Long extends Numeric

/**
* All `modQ` operations assume that Q is a global constant (an order of the only one cryptographically strong group
* which is used for all cryptographic operations). 
* So it is globally and implicitly used in all methods.
* */
class BigInt extends Numeric {
  /** Returns this `mod` Q, i.e. remainder of division by Q, where Q is an order of the cryprographic group.
   * @since 2.0
   */  
  def modQ: BigInt 
  /** Adds this number with `other` by module Q.
   * @since 2.0
   */  
  def plusModQ(other: BigInt): BigInt // Testnet2
  /** Subracts this number with `other` by module Q.
   * @since 2.0
   */  
  def minusModQ(other: BigInt): BigInt // Testnet2
  /** Multiply this number with `other` by module Q.
   * @since 2.0
   */  
  def multModQ(other: BigInt): BigInt // Testnet2
   /** Multiply this number with `other` by module Q.
    * @since Mainnet
    */   
  def multInverseModQ: BigInt // ??? @kushti do we need it 
}
```

#### Context Data 

Every script is executed in a context, which is a collection of data available for operations in the script.
The context data is available using variable `CONTEXT` which is of class `Context` defined below.
The following shortcut variables are available in every script to simplify access to the most commonly used context
data.

Variable          |  Type               | Shortcut for ...
------------------|---------------------|----------------------
`HEIGHT`          | `Int`               | `CONTEXT.height`
`SELF`            | `Box`               | `CONTEXT.selfBox` 
`INPUTS`          | `Coll[Box]`         | `CONTEXT.inputs`  
`OUTPUTS`         | `Coll[Box]`         | `CONTEXT.outputs` 

```scala
/**
  * Represents data available in ErgoScript using `CONTEXT` global variable
  * @since 2.0
  */
class Context {
  /** Height (block number) of the block which is currently being validated. */
  def height: Int
  
  /** Box whose proposition is being currently executing */
  def selfBox: Box
  
  /** Zero based index in `inputs` of `selfBox`. */
  def selfBoxIndex: Int
  
  /** A collection of inputs of the current transaction, the transaction where selfBox is one of the inputs. */
  def inputs: Coll[Box]
  
  /** A collection of data inputs of the current transaction. Data inputs are not going to be spent and thus don't
   * participate in transaction validation as `inputs`, but data boxes are available in guarding propositions of 
   * `inputs` and thus can be used in spending logic. 
   * @since 2.0
   */
  def dataInputs: Coll[Box]
  
  /** A collection of outputs of the current transaction. */
  def outputs: Coll[Box]
  
  /** Authenticated dynamic dictionary digest representing Utxo state before current state. */
  def lastBlockUtxoRoot: AvlTree
  
  /**
    * @since 2.0
    */
  def headers: Coll[SHeader] 
  /**
    * @since 2.0
    */
  def preheader: SPreheader  
}

/** Represents data of the block headers available in scripts.
 * @since 2.0
 */
class Header {  
  def version: Byte
  
  /** Bytes representation of ModifierId of the previous block in the blockchain */
  def parentId: Coll[Byte] // 
  
  def ADProofsRoot: Coll[Byte] // Digest32. Can we build AvlTree out of it? 
  def stateRoot: Coll[Byte]  // ADDigest  //33 bytes! extra byte with tree height here!
  def transactionsRoot: Coll[Byte]  // Digest32
  def timestamp: Long
  def nBits: Long  // actually it is unsigned Int 
  def height: Int
  def extensionRoot: Coll[Byte] // Digest32
  def minerPk: GroupElement    // pk
  def powOnetimePk: GroupElement  // w
  def powNonce: Coll[Byte]        // n
  def powDistance: BigInt        // d
}

/** Only header fields that can be predicted by a miner
 * @since 2.0
 */
class PreHeader { // Testnet2
  def version: Byte
  def parentId: Coll[Byte] // ModifierId
  def timestamp: Long
  def nBits: Long  // actually it is unsigned Int 
  def height: Int
  def minerPk: GroupElement
}

class AvlTree {
  /** Returns digest of the state represent by this tree. 
   * @since 2.0
   */
  def digest: Coll[Byte]
}
```

#### Box type

```scala
class Box {
  /** Box monetary value in NanoErg */
  def value: Long 
  
  /** Blake2b256 hash of this box's content, basically equals to `blake2b256(bytes)` */
  def id: Coll[Byte] 

  /** Serialized bytes of guarding script, which should be evaluated to true in order to open this box. */
  def propositionBytes: Coll[Byte] 
  
  /** Serialized bytes of this box's content, including proposition bytes. */
  def bytes: Coll[Byte] 
  
  /** Serialized bytes of this box's content, excluding transactionId and index of output. */
  def bytesWithoutRef: Coll[Byte]
    
  /** If `tx` is a transaction which generated this box, then `creationInfo._1` is a height of the tx's block.
   *  The `creationInfo._2` is a serialized transaction identifier followed by box index in the transaction outputs. 
   */
  def creationInfo: (Int, Coll[Byte]) 
  
  /** Synonym of R2 obligatory register
   * @since 2.0
   */
  def tokens: Coll[(Coll[Byte], Long)] 
  
  /** Extracts register by id and type. 
   * @param regId zero-based identifier of the register.
   * @tparam T expected type of the register.
   * @return Some(value) if the register is defined and has given type.
   *         None otherwise
   * @since 2.0
   */
  def getReg[T](regId: Int): Option[T]

  /** Extracts register as Coll[Byte], deserializes it to script and then executes this script in the current context. 
    * The original Coll[Byte] of the script is available as getReg[Coll[Byte]](id)
    * @param regId identifier of the register 
    * @tparam T result type of the deserialized script. 
    * @throws InterpreterException if the actual script type doesn't conform to T
    * @return result of the script execution in the current context
    * @since Mainnet
    */
  def executeFromRegister[T](regId: Byte): T
}
```

Besides properties, every box can have up to 10 numbered registers.
The following syntax is supported to access registers on box objects:
```
box.getReg[Int](3).get     // access R3 register, cast its value to Int and return it
box.getReg[Int](3).isDefined  // check that value of R3  is defined and has type Int
box.getReg[Int](3).isEmpty    // check that value of R3 is either undefined or have not Int type
box.getReg[Int](3).getOrElse(def) // access R3 value if defined, otherwise return def
```

#### GroupElement
```scala
class GroupElement {
  // ...
  /**
  * // this should replace the currently used ^ 
   * @since 2.0
   */
  def exp(n: BigInt): GroupElement // Testnet2 
}
```

#### AvlTree

```scala
class AvlTree {
  /**
   * @since 2.0
   */
  def digest: Coll[Byte]
}
```

#### Option[T]

```scala
/** Represents optional values. Instances of `Option`
 *  are either an instance of `Some(x)` or the value `None`.
 */
class Option[A] {
  /** Returns true if the option is None, false otherwise. 
   */  
  def isEmpty: Boolean;
  
  /** Returns true if the option is an instance of Some(value), false otherwise. 
   */
  def isDefined: Boolean;
  
  /** Returns the option's value if the option is nonempty, otherwise
   * return the result of evaluating `default`.
   *
   * @param default  the default expression, which is evaluated only if option is None.
   */
  def getOrElse[B](default: => B): B
  
  /** Returns the option's value.
   *  @note The option must be nonempty.
   *  @throws InterpreterException if the option is empty.
   */
  def get: A

  /** Returns a singleton collection containing the $option's value
   * if it is nonempty, or the empty collection if the $option is empty.
   * @since  2.0
   */
  def toColl: Coll[A]
  
  /** Returns a Some containing the result of applying $f to this option's
   * value if this option is nonempty.
   * Otherwise return None.
   *
   * @note This is similar to `flatMap` except here, $f does not need to wrap its result in an $option.

   */
  def map[B](f: A => B): Option[B]

Each item can be accessed by constant index, for example:
```
val myOutput = OUTPUTS(0)
val myInput = INPUTS(0)
```

Any collection have a `length` property which returns number of elements in a collection. 

```
val l = OUTPUTS.length
```

The following script check an existence of some element in the collection satisfying some
predicate (condition)

```
val ok = OUTPUTS.exists { (box: Box) => box.value > 1000 }
``` 

### Predefined global functions
<a name="PredefinedFunctions"></a>

ErgoScript standard library include predefined functions that can be called 
without prior declaration. 

The following function declarations are automatically imported into any script:

```scala

/** Returns true if at least on element of the conditions is true */

 * Usually it will require simple restructuring of the code to make the scope body explicit.
 * Invariants checked by the compiler:
 *  - single ZKProof in ErgoTree in a root position
 *  - no boolean operations in the body, because otherwise the result may be disclosed
 *  - all the operations are over SigmaProp values
