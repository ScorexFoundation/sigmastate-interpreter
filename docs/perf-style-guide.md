## Scala Performance Style Guide 

### Motivation

Scala is high-level language with powerful constructs and idioms to
build abstractions which provide a higher guarantee of code correctness and clarity.

However, many abstractions come with performance penalties that must be faced during runtime.
That said, a given task often has several unique alternative solutions, each with it's own tradeoffs. 
Some of these may in fact be more efficient while still providing a comparable level of abstraction and code clarity.

This document is a collection of such alternatives, specifically providing recommendations which can be used
in addition to the classical [Scala Style Guide](https://docs.scala-lang.org/style/)
 [1], these recipes are recommendations only, 
there are always exceptions.

This guide can be used by both code writers and reviewers to reason about code quality from
a performance point of view.
This is particularly important in those 20% of cases where a part of the codebase is known to be a hotspot or
hotspot candidate.

Please note that the performance measurements referred to in this guide are only 
examples of what to expect. These are not specifically exact numbers. 
Some optimizations can be easily measured, while others les so. Some measurements 
might be distorted in real world code by other optimizations which are not taken into 
account in the micro-benchmarks. 

### Empty Seq

One sees the use of `Seq()` quite often wherever an empty collection is required.
However, this means the following method from `GenericCompanion` is called

```scala
def apply[A](elems: A*): CC[A] = {
    if (elems.isEmpty) empty[A]
    else {
      val b = newBuilder[A]
      b ++= elems
      b.result()
    }
}
```

##### What to use instead

Simple `Nil` is 3-20x faster depending on the context 
(see  performance of "Seq" in [BasicBenchmarks.scala](https://github.com/scalan/special/blob/master/library/src/test/scala/special/collections/BasicBenchmarks.scala))

### Empty Map

`Map()` is often used wherever an empty Map is required.
However, this means the following method from `GenMapFactory` is called

```scala
def apply[A, B](elems: (A, B)*): CC[A, B] = (newBuilder[A, B] ++= elems).result()
```
##### What to use instead

Calling `Map.empty` is 50-70% faster depending on the context 
(see  performance of "Map" in [BasicBenchmarks.scala](https://github.com/scalan/special/blob/master/library/src/test/scala/special/collections/BasicBenchmarks.scala))


### Looping using `for`

Looping pattern `for (x <- xs) { ... }` is used quite often due to it's convenience.
It looks like `x is bound to each element and block of code is executed`.
However it is desugared to `xs.foreach { x => ... }` which, besides
execution of the block of code involves the following list of overheads:
1) `foreach` method call
2) allocation of lambda object
3) boxing of lambda argument for every xs item (if xs values are not yet boxed)
4) hidden overhead of concrete foreach implementation

##### What to use instead

The following code is recommended as a replacement if xs provides an O(1) indexing operator,
especially if `xs` is an `Array` wrapped into `Seq`.

```scala
import spire.syntax.all.cfor
cfor(0)(_ < xs.length, _ + 1) { i => 
  val x = xs(i)
      ...
}
```

Here `cfor` is a macros from [spire](https://github.com/non/spire) library.
This is compiled to efficient Java `for` loop and avoids overhead points 1) - 4).
Depending on xs.length it is 20-50x faster (see `BasicBenchmark.scala`).
And since `foreach` already implies a side effect operation, `cfor` doesn't make 
the code any less readable.

### Creating Sequences with Seq(...)

It is tempting to use `Seq.apply` method where a Seq of items is required like 
`Seq(1, 2, 3)` because it is easy and concise. You can pass it as method argument 
or as method result.
However, the following happens under the hood:
1) new Array with the items `1, 2, 3` is created, and each item is boxed into its own Integer object
2) WrappedArray#ofInt wrapper is created and passed as vararg argument of `Seq.apply`
3) the above mentioned method from `GenericCompanion` is called
4) new ListBuffer is created and all items are copied from array to the buffer

All of this would be executed by JVM interpreter thousands of time before compilation
threshold is reached and the HotSpot optimizer hopefully optimizes it away.

##### What to use instead

Simple drop-in replacement `Array(1, 2, 3)` would do the job.
The benchmark shows that this code is 4-10x faster than using `Seq(...)`.
Even if `tail` method on the created sequence is used, it is still 3x faster.
(see  performance of "Seq vs Array" in [BasicBenchmarks.scala](https://github.com/scalan/special/blob/master/library/src/test/scala/special/collections/BasicBenchmarks.scala)).

What happens here is that 1) native unboxed Java array is created and then
2) wrapped via implicit conversion `wrapIntArray` into a `WrappedArray#ofInt` 
object which is inherited from the `Seq` trait so it can be used directly. 

Why this is faster:
1) Avoids additional allocations (vs only two new objects are allocated in the Array case). 
Note that not only is each Int boxed into java.lang.Integer (or other primitive type), 
but also `scala.collection.immutable.::` instances are created for each item as well.
2) Avoids boxing (which is proportional to the size of Seq)
3) The accessing of array items is cache friendly both when the array is created and 
when it is later used
4) Less allocations means less garbage to collect later. This is especially 
important when the application is multi-threaded, because in this case the garbage 
collector will compete with application threads for CPU resources, thus further
slowing down the application.

This seems like a universal standard that is applicable everywhere as it doesn't make your code any less readable.
Do note that the arrays created in this way are only accessible via `Seq` interface, 
which is immutable. Thus, better performance is achieved without sacrificing other
desirable code qualities like readability, safety, conciseness.

### Abstract class vs trait

Traits are more flexible than classes because they can be mixed in various ways. 
This makes them convenient when the code is prototyped and when the code shape is 
still changing. They are also easier to type. 

However traits come with inherent performance penalties. Invocation of a trait's method
results in the `invokeinterface` JVM opcode instead of the `invokevirtual` opcode for 
class method invocation. What this means is that first the HotSpot JIT needs to do more work to optimize 
execution of `invokeinterface`, which is not always possible. Secondly, if it fails 
to optimize, then every call will have an additional method search before an actual 
invocation takes place.

##### What to use instead

When prototyping use `abstract class` instead of a `trait` declaration by default.
This way you avoid over generalization of your type hierarchy, ain addition to having a
better understanding of where you really need to use traits and why.

It's as simple as changing `trait` declarations to `abstract class` and you get performance gains for for next to free.
Be aware that this however is not always possible with published APIs as it may break compatibility.

### Name Based Extractors

An extractor is an object with an `unapply` method taking an arbitrary argument 
and returning an Option of some other type:

```
def unapply(any: A): Option[B]
```

Here is a simple example:

```
object PositiveInt {
  def unapply(n: Int): Option[Int] =
    if (n > 0) Some(n) else None
}
```

With extractors, pattern matching can be concise and expressive. 
However, unapply returning an Option might have a negative impact on runtime performance, 
because on every matching call an instance of Some needs to be created for each 
successful extraction.

##### What to use instead

Scala 2.11 introduces *name based extractors* which no longer require `unapply` to return 
an `Option`. Combined with [value classes](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/value-classes.html) 
these two features allow to implement *allocation free* extractors which are 1.5-2x faster then
original Option based extractors (see [BasicBenchmarks.scala](https://github.com/scalan/special/blob/master/library/src/test/scala/special/collections/BasicBenchmarks.scala)).

Suitable implementation can be found in [spire](https://github.com/typelevel/spire) library, 
in an [spire.util.Opt](https://github.com/typelevel/spire/blob/master/util/src/main/scala/spire/util/Opt.scala) 
class which is based on the above two Scala features.

### Concluding remarks

Program performance upkeep & optimization is the result of constant vigilance and work, rather than just a one time job.
There is no *one size fits all* solution as there are many trade-offs along the way.
