\section{Serialization format of ErgoTree nodes}
\label{sec:appendix:ergotree_serialization}

All operations have the same serialization format, in which OpCode byte is serialized
first and then the content of the operation is serialized as described in the following
subsections.

Note, these subsections are autogenerated from instrumented ValueSerializers of the
reference implementation.
