\section{\langname As A Language}
\label{sec:language}

In this section we define an abstract syntax for the \langname language. It is a typed
call-by-value, higher-order functional language without recursion. It supports
single-assignment blocks, tuples, optional values, indexed collections with
higher-order operations, short-cutting logicals, ternary 'if' with lazy branches. All
operations are deterministic, without side effects and all values are immutable.

The semantics of \langname is specified by first translating it to a core calculus
(\corelang) and then by giving its denotational evaluation semantics. Typing rules are
given in section~\ref{sec:typing} and the evaluation semantics is given in
section~\ref{sec:evaluation}. In section~\ref{sec:serialization} we describe serialization format of
\langname. Guidance on compliant interpreter implementation is provided in
section~\ref{sec:implementation}.

\langname is defined below using abstract syntax notation as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:language}. This corresponds to \lst{Value} class of the reference
implementation, which can be serialized to an array of bytes using
\lst{ValueSerializer}. The mnemonic names shown in the figure correspond to classes of
the reference implementation.

We assign types to the terms in a standard way following typing rules shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:typing}.

Constants keep both the type and the data value of that type. To be
well-formed the type of the constant should correspond to its value.

Variables are always typed and identified by unique $id$, which refers to
either lambda bound variable or a \lst{val} bound variable. 

Lambda expressions can take a list of lambda-bound variables which can be
used in the body expression, which can be a \emph{block expression}. 

Function application takes an expression of functional type (e.g. $T_1 \to
T_n$) and a list of arguments. The reason we do not write it $e_f(\Ov{e})$
is that this notation suggests that $(\Ov{e})$ is a subterm, which it is not.

Method invocation allows to apply functions defined as \emph{methods of types}. If
expression $e$ has type $T$ and and method $m$ is declared in the type $T$ then method
invocation $e.m(args)$ is defined for the appropriate $args$. See
section~\ref{sec:appendix:predeftypes} for the specification of types and their
methods.

Conditional expressions of \langname are strict in the condition and lazy in both
of the branches. Each branch is an expression which is executed depending on
the result of condition. This laziness of branches specified by lowering to
\corelang (see Figure~\ref{fig:lowering}).

Block expression contains a list of \lst{val} definitions of variables. To be
wellformed each subsequent definition can only refer to the previously defined
variables. Result of block execution is the result of the resulting
expression $e$, which can refer to any variable of the block.

Each type may be associated with a list of method declarations, in which case
we say that \emph{the type has methods}. The semantics of the methods is the
same as in Java. Having an instance of some type with methods it is possible
to call methods on the instance with some additional arguments.
Each method can be parameterized by type variables, which
can be used in method signature. Because \langname supports only monomorphic
values each method call is monomorphic and all type variables are assigned to
concrete types (see \lst{MethodCall} typing rule in Figure~\ref{fig:typing}).

The semantics of \langname is specified by translating all its terms to a somewhat
lower and simplified language, which we call \corelang and which doesn't have lazy
operations. This \emph{lowering} translation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lowering}.

Note that $\IfThenElse{e_{cond}}{e_1}{e_2}$ term of \langname has lazy evaluation of
its branches whereas right-hand-side $if$ is a primitive operation and have strict
evaluation of the arguments. The laziness is achieved by using lambda expressions of
\lst{Unit} $\Rightarrow$ \lst{Boolean} type.

We translate logical operations (\lst{||}, \lst{&&}) of \langname, which are
lazy on second argument to \lst{if} term of \langname, which is recursively
translated to the corresponding \corelang term.

Syntactic blocks of \langname are completely eliminated and translated to nested lambda
expressions, which unambiguously specify evaluation semantics of blocks. The semantics
of \corelang is specified in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}.

Note, that we use lowering transformation only to specify semantics. Implementations
can optimize by evaluating ErgoTree directly as long as the semantics is preserved.
