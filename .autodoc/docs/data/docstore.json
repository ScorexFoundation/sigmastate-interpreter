It then adds two lines to the `gpg.conf` file: `use-agent` and `pinentry-mode loopback`. These lines configure GPG to use an agent for passphrase management and to use a loopback mechanism for pinentry, which allows the passphrase to be entered via parameters.

Finally, it sets the permissions of all files in the `.gnupg` directory to 600 and reloads the GPG agent.\n\nThe script then decodes the GPG signing key, which should have been previously exported and stored as a GitHub repository secret under the name `GPG_SIGNING_KEY`.

The toOption method returns an Option containing the value of the Nullable object if it is not null, otherwise it returns None.\n\nThe AVHashMap class is designed to provide an allocation-free alternative to Scala's mutable Map class. It is a wrapper around a Java HashMap that provides methods such as isEmpty, get, apply, containsKey, put, and clear. The get method returns a Nullable object containing the value associated with the given key if it exists in the map, otherwise it returns a Nullable object containing null.

The containsKey method returns true if the given key exists in the map, otherwise it returns false. The put method associates the given value with the given key in the map and returns the previous value associated with the key, if any. The clear method removes all entries from the map. \n\nThe AVHashMap class also provides two helper methods, apply and fromSeq. The apply method creates a new AVHashMap with the given initial capacity. The fromSeq method creates a new AVHashMap from a sequence of key-value pairs. \n\nThese classes can be used in the larger project to optimize performance-critical code by avoiding unnecessary allocations and memory accesses.

For example, a concrete subclass of DFunc could be defined to perform a mathematical operation on unboxed Int values, such as addition or multiplication. This would allow the function to be called with unboxed values, avoiding the overhead of boxing and unboxing.\n\nHere is an example of how a concrete subclass of DFunc could be defined:\n\n```scala\nclass IntAddition extends DFunc[Int, Int] {\n  def apply(x: Int): Int = x + 1\n}\n```\n\nThis defines a function that takes an unboxed Int value and returns the result of adding 1 to it.

The `Lazy` class is a non-thread safe, but efficient on a single thread, immutable lazy value. The class takes a block of code as a parameter, which is executed only once. The `value` method of the class checks if the `_isSet` variable is false. If it is false, then the block of code is executed and the `_value` variable is set to the result of the block. The `_isSet` variable is then set to true. If `_isSet` is already true, then the `_value` variable is returned. \n\nThe `isSet` method returns the value of the `_isSet` variable. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the lazy value. If `_isSet` is false, then the string \"<lazy>\" is returned. Otherwise, the `toString` method of the `_value` variable is called and its result is returned.\n\nThe `Lazy` object has a single method called `apply`. The `apply` method takes a block of code as a parameter and returns a new instance of the `Lazy` class with the block of code as its parameter.\n\nThis code can be used in a larger project to create lazy values that are only evaluated once. This can be useful for expensive computations or for values that are only needed occasionally. For example, if a project needs to compute a large dataset, it can use the `Lazy` class to create a lazy value that computes the dataset only when it is needed. This can save time and resources by avoiding unnecessary computations. \n\nHere is an example of how the `Lazy` class can be used:\n\n```\nval lazyValue = Lazy {\n  println(\"Computing expensive value...\")\n  Thread.sleep(1000)\n  42\n}\n\nprintln(\"Lazy value created.\")\nprintln(lazyValue.value)\nprintln(lazyValue.value)\n```\n\nIn this example, a new lazy value is created with a block of code that computes an expensive value (in this case, the number 42). The `println` statement before the `value` method is called shows that the lazy value is only created once. The `println` statements after the `value` method is called show that the value is cached and not recomputed.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `@volatile` keyword in front of the `_isSet` variable?\n   \n   The `@volatile` keyword ensures that the `_isSet` variable is always read from and written to main memory, rather than being cached in a thread's local memory. This is important for thread safety in multi-threaded environments.\n\n2. Can the `block` parameter of the `Lazy` class be null?\n   \n   Yes, the `block` parameter can be null, but attempting to access the `value` of a `Lazy` instance with a null `block` will result in a `NullPointerException`.\n\n3. Is the `Lazy` class thread-safe?\n   \n   No, the `Lazy` class is not thread-safe.

To avoid this issue, the \"OverloadHack\" object defines three classes that extend a trait called \"Overloaded\". Each of these classes has a unique \"toString\" method that returns a different string representation of the class.\n\nAdditionally, the object defines three implicit values of each of the overloaded classes. These implicit values can be used as arguments in overloaded methods to differentiate between them. For example, if we have two methods with the same name and number of arguments, but one takes a list of integers and the other takes a list of strings, we can use the \"Overloaded1\" and \"Overloaded2\" implicit values to differentiate between them:\n\n```\ndef m1(l: List[Int])(implicit o: Overloaded1)\ndef m2(l: List[String])(implicit o: Overloaded2)\n```\n\nBy including the implicit argument in the method signature, we can ensure that the compiler will treat these methods as distinct, even after erasure.\n\nOverall, the \"OverloadHack\" object provides a useful workaround for the issue of method argument type erasure in Scala, allowing developers to define overloaded methods with distinct signatures.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a Scala object called OverloadHack that provides a trick to avoid compilation errors due to erasure of method argument types.\n\n2. How does the trick work?\n   The trick involves defining implicit arguments of different types for methods with identical signatures after erasure, which allows the compiler to differentiate between them and avoid the compilation error.\n\n3. Can this trick be used in other contexts besides Scala?\n   It is possible that similar tricks could be used in other languages or contexts where erasure of method argument types is an issue, but the specifics would depend on the language and context.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/shared/src/main/scala/scalan/OverloadHack.md"}}],["12",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/common/shared/src/main/scala/scalan/TypeDesc.scala)\n\nThe code defines a hierarchy of runtime type descriptors used to represent the structure of data values in the Sigma programming language. The RType abstract class is the base type for all runtime type descriptors. It is parameterized by a type parameter A, which represents the type of the data value being described. The class has three methods: classTag, name, and emptyArray. The classTag method returns a ClassTag instance suitable for constructing instances of Array[A]. The name method returns a syntactically correct type name (type expression as String). The emptyArray method creates an empty immutable array of this type.\n\nThe RType object contains helper methods and classes to request RType instances from an implicit scope. It also contains a set of predefined RType instances for primitive types such as Boolean, Byte, Short, Int, Long, Char, Float, Double, and Unit. Additionally, it defines RType instances for more complex types such as String, pairs, arrays, options, and thunks.\n\nThe RType hierarchy is used to check the actual type of data values in registers and context variables against the expected type in the script. For example, the getReg and getVar methods in the Sigma interpreter use RType instances to check the type of the data value stored in a register or context variable.\n\nOverall, the RType hierarchy is an essential component of the Sigma programming language, enabling type checking and ensuring the correctness of scripts.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It returns a sequence of pairs of keys and results.\n\nThe `AnyOps` implicit class provides a `traverseDepthFirst` method that traverses a tree of elements depth-first and returns a list of elements.\n\nThe `TraversableOps` implicit class provides several methods for working with collections. The `updateMany` method returns a copy of the collection where elements at the specified indices are replaced with the specified values. The `cast` method checks that each element of the collection is of a specified type and returns the collection casted to that type. The `distinctBy` method returns a new collection with duplicate elements removed based on a key function. The `sameElements2` method checks if two collections have the same elements in the same order, including nested collections and arrays.\n\nOverall, the CollectionUtil object provides a set of useful utility functions for working with collections in Scala. These functions can be used in a variety of contexts to manipulate and transform collections.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This method is used in deserialization to ensure that a `BigInteger` value can be safely converted to a fixed-size byte array without losing information. \n\nThe code also includes an implicit class called `Ensuring`, which provides a way to add runtime assertions to any value. The `ensuring` method takes a condition and an error message, and throws an exception if the condition is not met.

The method returns a `DSet` of nodes reachable from the `starts` including `starts` themselves. The `neighbours` function takes a node `s` and returns a `DBuffer` of its neighbors. The method uses a recursive `visit` function to traverse the graph starting from each node in the `starts` buffer. The `visited` set keeps track of the nodes that have already been visited to avoid revisiting them. \n\nThe `depthFirstOrderFrom` method also takes a `starts` buffer and a `neighbours` function as parameters. It returns a topologically ordered `DBuffer` of nodes reachable from the `starts` including `starts` themselves. The method uses a similar recursive `visit` function as the `depthFirstSetFrom` method, but it also appends each visited node to a `res` buffer after visiting all of its neighbors. This ensures that the nodes are added to the result buffer in the correct order. \n\nBoth methods use the `cfor` loop from the `debox` library to iterate over the nodes in the `starts` buffer and the neighbors of each visited node. The `@specialized(Int)` annotation on the type parameter `A` ensures that the method is optimized for `Int` types. The `ClassTag` context bound on the type parameter `A` allows the method to create new instances of the type `A` at runtime. \n\nThese methods can be used in a larger project to analyze graphs and extract information about their structure. For example, they could be used to find all the nodes that are reachable from a given set of starting nodes, or to order the nodes in a graph based on their dependencies. The methods could also be extended to handle weighted graphs or directed graphs by modifying the `neighbours` function. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport scalan.util.GraphUtil\n\nval graph = Map(\n  1 -> List(2, 3),\n  2 -> List(4),\n  3 -> List(4),\n  4 -> List()\n)\n\nval starts = debox.Buffer.of(1)\nval neighbours = (n: Int) => debox.Buffer.fromIterable(graph.getOrElse(n, List()))\n\nval reachableNodes = GraphUtil.depthFirstSetFrom(starts)(neighbours)\nval orderedNodes = GraphUtil.depthFirstOrderFrom(starts, neighbours)\n\nprintln(reachableNodes) // DSet(1, 2, 3, 4)\nprintln(orderedNodes) // DBuffer(4, 2, 3, 1)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

Memoization is a technique that involves caching the results of a function so that it can be retrieved on repeated invocations with the same argument. This can be useful in situations where the function is computationally expensive and is called frequently with the same arguments.\n\nThe `MemoizedFunc` class takes a function `f` as its input and returns a new function that is memoized. The memoization is implemented by computing the function `f` only once for each argument value and storing the computed result in a hash table. The hash table is implemented using the `AVHashMap` class, which is a custom implementation of a hash table that is optimized for performance.\n\nThe `apply` method of the `MemoizedFunc` class is used to apply the memoized function to a given argument. If the result for the argument is already present in the hash table, it is retrieved and returned. Otherwise, the function `f` is computed for the argument, and the result is stored in the hash table for future use.\n\nThe `reset` method of the `MemoizedFunc` class is used to clear the cache of memoized results. This can be useful in situations where the function `f` is updated or the arguments change, and the cached results are no longer valid.\n\nOverall, the `MemoizedFunc` class provides a simple and efficient way to memoize a function in Scala. It can be used in a variety of contexts where memoization is useful, such as in machine learning algorithms or in web applications that require frequent computations. Here is an example of how to use the `MemoizedFunc` class:\n\n```\nval memoizedFunc = new MemoizedFunc((x: Int) => {\n  // Some expensive computation\n  x * x\n})\n\nval result1 = memoizedFunc(5) // Computes result for 5\nval result2 = memoizedFunc(5) // Retrieves cached result for 5\nmemoizedFunc.reset() // Clears the cache\nval result3 = memoizedFunc(5) // Computes result for 5 again\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

This class is only returned by the non-deterministic choice operator. The `p` and `q` parameters are evaluated at most once.\n\nThe `PlusStrategy` class has three properties:\n\n1. `left`: The left alternative of the choice.\n2. `right`: The right alternative of the choice.\n3. `s`: The strategy itself (lazily computed).\n\nThe `left` and `right` properties are lazily evaluated, meaning that they are only computed when they are needed. The `s` property is also lazily computed and is the result of applying the `<+` operator to the `left` and `right` properties.\n\nThe `apply` method is the implementation of this strategy. It takes an argument `t` of type `Any` and applies the `s` strategy to it.\n\nThis class is useful in the larger project as it provides a way to define non-deterministic choice operators and conditional choices. It allows for the creation of complex strategies that can be used to transform and manipulate code. Here is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```scala\nval p = new PlusStrategy(s1, s2)\nval result = p.apply(input)\n```\n\nIn this example, `s1` and `s2` are two strategies that are combined using the `PlusStrategy` class to create a non-deterministic choice operator. The `apply` method is then called on the resulting `PlusStrategy` object with an input argument `input`. The `apply` method applies the combined strategy to the input and returns the result.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `Strategy` class is abstract and defines a function that takes a term of any type as input and either succeeds producing a new term (`Some`), or fails (`None`). The class also defines several methods for composing strategies, including sequential composition, deterministic choice, and non-deterministic choice. \n\nThe `mkStrategy` method creates a new strategy with the given function. The `<*` method constructs a strategy that first applies this strategy. If it succeeds, then apply `q` to the new subject term. Otherwise, fail. The `<+` method constructs a strategy that first applies this strategy. If it succeeds, succeed with the resulting term. Otherwise, apply `q` to the original subject term. The `+` method constructs a non-deterministic choice strategy that first applies either this strategy or the given strategy. If it succeeds, succeed with the resulting term. Otherwise, apply `q`. The `<` method constructs a conditional choice strategy that first applies this strategy (`c`). If `c` succeeds, the strategy applies `l` to the resulting term, otherwise it applies `r` to the original subject term.\n\nThese strategies can be used to transform terms in a larger project. For example, suppose we have a term representing a mathematical expression, and we want to simplify it by applying a set of rewriting rules. We can define a set of rewriting strategies using the `Strategy` class, and then apply them to the expression using the `apply` method. For example:\n\n```\nval expr: Expr = ... // some expression\nval rules: Strategy = ... // set of rewriting strategies\nval simplified = rules(expr).getOrElse(expr)\n```\n\nThis code applies the set of rewriting strategies to the expression `expr`. If any of the strategies succeed, the resulting term is returned. Otherwise, the original expression is returned. This allows us to simplify the expression using a set of rewriting rules, without having to manually apply each rule in turn.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a set of strategies for rewriting terms of any type.\n\n2. What is the difference between the `<*` and `<+` methods?\n- The `<*` method applies the current strategy and then applies a second strategy to the resulting term if the first strategy succeeds.

This can be used in the larger project to provide a flexible and extensible mechanism for term rewriting.\n\n**CallbackRewriter.scala** extends the `Rewriter` trait and provides a method `rewriting` that is called whenever a rewrite operation has happened. This method takes two arguments, the old term and the new term, and returns a term that should go forward as the new term. The `dispatch`, `rule`, `rulef`, `rulefs`, `strategy`, `strategyf`, and `dup` methods are overridden to use the `dispatch` method to create a new strategy that can be used to rewrite terms.\n\n**PlusStrategy.scala** is a helper class that is used to contain commonality of choice in non-deterministic choice operator and then-else part of a conditional choice. It provides a way to define non-deterministic choice operators and conditional choices, allowing for the creation of complex strategies that can be used to transform and manipulate code. For example:\n\n```scala\nval p = new PlusStrategy(s1, s2)\nval result = p.apply(input)\n```\n\nIn this example, `s1` and `s2` are two strategies that are combined using the `PlusStrategy` class to create a non-deterministic choice operator. The `apply` method is then called on the resulting `PlusStrategy` object with an input argument `input`. The `apply` method applies the combined strategy to the input and returns the result.\n\n**Strategy.scala** defines the `Strategy` class, which is abstract and defines a function that takes a term of any type as input and either succeeds producing a new term (`Some`), or fails (`None`). The class also defines several methods for composing strategies, including sequential composition, deterministic choice, and non-deterministic choice. These strategies can be used to transform terms in a larger project. For example:\n\n```scala\nval expr: Expr = ... // some expression\nval rules: Strategy = ... // set of rewriting strategies\nval simplified = rules(expr).getOrElse(expr)\n```\n\nThis code applies the set of rewriting strategies to the expression `expr`. If any of the strategies succeed, the resulting term is returned. Otherwise, the original expression is returned. This allows us to simplify the expression using a set of rewriting rules, without having to manually apply each rule in turn.\n\nOverall, the code in this folder provides a powerful mechanism for term rewriting with callbacks. It allows clients to register functions that are called whenever a rewrite operation has happened, and provides a set of methods that can be used to create new strategies for rewriting terms.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/kiama/rewriting/summary.md"}}],["34",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/.autodoc/docs/json/common/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/kiama)\n\nThe code in the `.autodoc/docs/json/common/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/kiama` folder is part of the Kiama Scala library for language processing. This library provides components for tree decoration, tree transformation, dynamic semantics, and pretty-printing, which can be used in the larger project for various language processing tasks.\n\nFor example, the `kiama.scala` file defines two type constructors for partial functions, `==>` and `===>`. These constructors can be used to define partial functions in a concise way, which can be helpful when working with tree transformations or other language processing tasks. Here's an example of how these type constructors can be used:\n\n```scala\nval square: Int ==> Int = {\n  case x if x >= 0 => x * x\n}\n\nval increment: Int ===> Int = {\n  case x if x < 10 => x + 1\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `square` is a partial function that squares non-negative integers, and `increment` is a partial function that increments integers less than 10. These partial functions can be used in combination with other Kiama components for various language processing tasks.\n\nThe `rewriting` subfolder contains code for term rewriting strategies, which can be used to transform and manipulate code in the larger project.

The module provides several methods for comparing values, collections, and sequences. The module is located in the `sigmastate.kiama.util` package.\n\n## `same(v1: Any, v2: Any): Boolean`\n\nThis method compares two arbitrary values. If both values are references and not tuples, it uses reference equality. If they are tuples, it uses `same` to compare the components. Otherwise, it uses value equality. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the two values are the same.\n\n## `TOrdering[T]`\n\nThis is a class that implements an ordering that says two values are equal if `same` says they are, otherwise earlier elements are greater than later ones.\n\n## `sameCollection(v1: Any, v2: Any): Boolean`\n\nThis method compares two `Iterable` collections or options and tuples containing that kind of collection. It uses `same` to compare the individual elements in the same order. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the two collections are the same.\n\n## `sameElements[T](t1: Seq[_], t2: Seq[_]): Boolean`\n\nThis method compares two `Seq` collections or options and tuples containing that kind of collection. It uses `same` to compare the individual elements in any order. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the two collections are the same.\n\n## `optsame(v1: Any, v2: Any): Boolean`\n\nThis method is similar to `same`, except that if the two values are `Some` options containing references, they are unwrapped first, and the contents are compared by reference.\n\n## `contains[T](s: Iterable[T], t: T): Boolean`\n\nThis method checks whether the iterable `s` contains `t`. Equality is tested using `same`.\n\n## `distinct[T](s: Seq[T]): Vector[T]`\n\nThis method returns a vector with only the distinct elements from the sequence `s`. \"Distinct\" in this case means compare using `same`.\n\n## `flatDistinct[T](ss: Seq[Seq[T]]): Vector[T]`\n\nThis method is similar to `distinct`, but it works over a sequence of sequences.\n\n## `indexOf[T](s: Seq[T], elem: T): Int`\n\nThis method returns the first zero-based index at which `elem` occurs in `s` using `same` to perform comparisons, or -1 if `elem` does not occur in `s`.\n\n## `lastIndexOf[T](s: Seq[T], elem: T): Int`\n\nThis method returns the last zero-based index at which `elem` occurs in `s` using `same` to perform comparisons, or -1 if `elem` does not occur in `s`.\n\nOverall, the `Comparison` module provides a set of utility methods for comparing values, collections, and sequences in the Kiama project.

It defines a Scala object called `Collections` that contains several methods for converting between Java and Scala collections, as well as for building collections.\n\n### Converting Java collections to Scala collections\n\nThe first set of methods are for converting Java collections to Scala collections. These methods use the `JavaConverters` library to convert a Java collection to a Scala collection. For example, the `javaCollectionToVector` method takes a `java.util.Collection` and returns a `Vector`, which is a type of immutable sequence in Scala:\n\n```scala\nimport java.util.ArrayList\nimport sigmastate.kiama.util.Collections._\n\nval javaList = new ArrayList[String]()\njavaList.add(\"hello\")\njavaList.add(\"world\")\n\nval scalaVector = javaCollectionToVector(javaList)\n```\n\n### Converting Scala collections to Java collections\n\nThe second and third methods, `mapToJavaMap` and `seqToJavaList`, take a Scala `Map` and `Seq` respectively and return their Java counterparts, `java.util.Map` and `java.util.List`. These methods can be useful when working with Java libraries that require Java collections as input:\n\n```scala\nimport scala.collection.immutable.HashMap\nimport java.util.List\nimport sigmastate.kiama.util.Collections._\n\nval scalaMap = HashMap(\"one\" -> 1, \"two\" -> 2)\nval javaMap = mapToJavaMap(scalaMap)\n\nval scalaSeq = Seq(\"hello\", \"world\")\nval javaList: List[String] = seqToJavaList(scalaSeq)\n```\n\n### Building collections\n\nThe `newBuilder` method takes a `Factory` or `CanBuildFrom` object and returns a `Builder` object. The `Factory` and `CanBuildFrom` types are part of the Scala collections library and are used to create new collections. The `newBuilder` method can be used to create a new `Builder` object that can be used to add elements to a collection:\n\n```scala\nimport scala.collection.mutable.Builder\nimport scala.collection.immutable.Vector\nimport sigmastate.kiama.util.Collections._\n\nval builder: Builder[String, Vector[String]] = newBuilder(Vector)\nbuilder += \"hello\"\nbuilder += \"world\"\n\nval scalaVector = builder.result()\n```\n\nIn summary, the `Collections.scala` file provides useful utility functions for working with collections in Scala, particularly when interfacing with Java libraries.

For example:\n\n  ```scala\n  import scala.collection.immutable.Vector\n  import sigmastate.kiama.util.Collections._\n\n  val canBuildFrom = implicitly[CanBuildFrom[Vector[Int], Int, Vector[Int]]]\n  val builder = newBuilder(canBuildFrom)\n  ```\n\nIn conclusion, the utility functions provided in the `Collections.scala` file are valuable for simplifying the process of working with collections in mixed Scala and Java codebases. They offer a convenient way to convert between collection types and build collections of the desired type, making it easier to integrate Scala and Java code within a project.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/shared/src/main/scala-2.13/summary.md"}}],["55",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/.autodoc/docs/json/common/shared/src/main)\n\nThe code in the `.autodoc/docs/json/common/shared/src/main` folder and its subfolders play a crucial role in providing compatibility, utility functions, and language processing capabilities for the larger project.

The purpose of this file is to provide a set of commonly used functions that can be used across the project. \n\nThe first function in the file is \"loopUntil\", which takes three arguments: an initial value of type A, a function that takes a value of type A and returns a Boolean, and a function that takes a value of type A and returns a new value of type A. The function loops through the values of type A until the isMatch function returns true, and then returns the final value of type A. This function can be used to perform a loop until a certain condition is met, which is a common operation in many programs.\n\nThe second function in the file is \"cast\", which takes an argument of type Any and returns an Option of type T. The function uses Scala's ClassTag to check if the argument is of type T, and if so, returns Some(v.asInstanceOf[T]). Otherwise, it returns None. This function can be used to safely cast an object to a specific type, and handle the case where the cast fails.\n\nThe third function in the file is \"some\", which takes an argument of type A and returns an Option of type A with the argument as its value. This function can be used to create an Option with a non-null value.\n\nThe fourth function in the file is \"none\", which takes an implicit argument of type RType[A] and returns an empty Option of type A. This function can be used to create an empty Option of a specific type.\n\nThe fifth function in the file is \"optionGetOrElse\", which takes two arguments: an Option of type A and a default value of type A. The function returns the value of the Option if it is not empty, or the default value otherwise. This function can be used to provide a default value when an Option is empty.\n\nThe last object in the file is \"rewritableMethod\", which throws an error message.

This is achieved by first creating a builder object for the collection, which is used to extract the two components of each pair into separate collections of type Coll[A] and Coll[B]. The foreach method then iterates over each index in the collection and applies the function f to the corresponding elements from the two component collections.\n\nThese implicit classes can be used in the larger project to simplify the process of iterating over collections of elements or pairs of elements. For example, suppose we have a collection of integers and we want to print each element to the console. We can use the foreach method from the CollOps implicit class as follows:\n\n```\nimport special.collection.Extensions._\n\nval coll = Coll(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\ncoll.foreach(println)\n```\n\nThis will print the numbers 1 through 5 to the console. Similarly, suppose we have a collection of pairs of integers and we want to compute the sum of each pair. We can use the foreach method from the PairCollOps implicit class as follows:\n\n```\nimport special.collection.Extensions._\n\nval coll = Coll((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))\nvar sum = 0\ncoll.foreach((a, b) => sum += a + b)\nprintln(sum) // prints 21\n```\n\nThis will compute the sum of each pair and store the result in the variable sum, which is then printed to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this code is to ensure that collections being compared have the same number of elements, which is a common requirement in many algorithms and operations.\n\nThe `Helpers` object contains a private method called `sameLengthErrorMsg` that takes two collections of different types `A` and `B` as input parameters. This method returns an error message string that indicates the lengths of the two collections and their contents. The error message is used to inform the user that the collections being compared do not have the same length.\n\nThe `requireSameLength` method is a public method that takes two collections of different types `A` and `B` as input parameters. This method uses the `require` function to check if the lengths of the two collections are equal. If the lengths are not equal, the `sameLengthErrorMsg` method is called to generate an error message that is then thrown as an exception.\n\nThis code can be used in a larger project to ensure that collections being compared have the same length. For example, if a project requires comparing two arrays of data, this code can be used to ensure that the arrays have the same number of elements before performing any operations on them. \n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```scala\nimport special.collection.Helpers._\n\nval arr1 = Array(1, 2, 3)\nval arr2 = Array(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n\nrequireSameLength(arr1, arr2) // throws an exception with an error message\n```\n\nIn this example, the `requireSameLength` method is called with two arrays of different types. Since the arrays have different lengths, the method throws an exception with an error message generated by the `sameLengthErrorMsg` method.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This package is located at `.autodoc/docs/json/core-lib/shared/src/main/scala/special/sigma`. The code in this folder is responsible for defining the data structures, operations, and functions that are used to create, manipulate, and validate Sigma expressions.\n\nHere is a brief overview of the main files in this folder:\n\n1. `SigmaDsl.scala`: This file defines the main entry point for the Sigma DSL. It provides a high-level API for creating and manipulating Sigma expressions, as well as for evaluating and validating them. The `SigmaDsl` object extends the `SigmaDslBuilder` trait, which defines the core functionality of the DSL.\n\n   Example usage:\n   ```scala\n   import special.sigma.SigmaDsl\n\n   val sigmaExpr = SigmaDsl.sigmaProp(SigmaDsl.anyOf(Seq(SigmaDsl.Height > 100, SigmaDsl.Self.R4[Long].get > 1000)))\n   ```\n\n2. `SigmaDslBuilder.scala`: This file defines the `SigmaDslBuilder` trait, which is the core interface for building Sigma expressions.

This is useful in larger projects where the code structure may not be known at compile time. For example, the `SigmaProp` class registers methods like `$bar$bar`, `isValid`, and `propBytes`.\n\nThe `SpecialPredef.scala` file provides a set of utility functions and objects for common operations such as looping, casting, and handling Options. For instance, the `loopUntil` function can be used to perform a loop until a certain condition is met:\n\n```scala\nval result = loopUntil(0, (x: Int) => x >= 10, (x: Int) => x + 1) // result: 10\n```\n\nThe `Types.scala` file defines types and functions related to tuples, allowing the representation and manipulation of tuples of arbitrary types in a type-safe manner.

The first method is called VLQ encoding, which stands for Variable Length Quantity encoding. This method takes a long integer value as input and encodes it into a sequence of bytes that can be efficiently stored in memory. The encoded value is stored in a byte buffer, which is a fixed-size array of bytes.\n\nThe encoding process works by breaking the input value into 7-bit chunks and storing each chunk in a separate byte. The most significant bit of each byte is set to 1 to indicate that there are more bytes to follow. The least significant byte has its most significant bit set to 0 to indicate that it is the last byte in the sequence. This ensures that the encoded value can be reconstructed correctly by reading the bytes in the correct order.\n\nThe second method is called ZigZag encoding, which is used to encode signed integers into values that can be efficiently encoded with VLQ encoding. This method takes a signed 64-bit integer as input and returns an unsigned 64-bit integer, stored in a signed int because Java has no explicit unsigned support.\n\nThe encoding process works by first left-shifting the input value by 1 bit and then performing a bitwise XOR operation with the right-shifted input value by 63 bits. This converts the signed integer into an unsigned integer that can be encoded using VLQ encoding.\n\nThese encoding methods are useful for compressing large integer values that need to be stored or transmitted efficiently. They can be used in a variety of applications, such as data compression, network protocols, and file formats. For example, they could be used to compress large datasets in a database or to encode metadata in a file format. Here is an example of how to use the VLQ encoding method:\n\n```\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[10];\nint position = 0;\nlong value = 1234567890L;\nputULong(value);\n```\n\nThis code creates a byte buffer of size 10 and initializes the position to 0. It then encodes the long integer value using the putULong method and stores the encoded bytes in the buffer. The encoded value can be retrieved by reading the bytes from the buffer in the correct order and decoding them using the reverse process.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the \\texttt{putULong} method?\n   \n   The \\texttt{putULong} method is used for compressed encoding of integer values using variable-length quantity (VLQ) encoding.\n\n2. What is ZigZag encoding and why is it used?\n   \n   ZigZag encoding is a method of encoding signed integers into values that can be efficiently encoded with varint. It is used to avoid sign-extension of negative values to 64 bits, which would always take 10 bytes in the buffer.\n\n3. Why is the returned value of \\texttt{encodeZigZag64} stored in a signed int instead of an unsigned long?\n   \n   The returned value of \\texttt{encodeZigZag64} is stored in a signed int because Java has no explicit support for unsigned types.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/docs/spec/appendix_integer_encoding.md"}}],["87",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/docs/spec/appendix_motivation.tex)\n\nThis code is a technical explanation of the motivations and rationale behind the serialization format and constant segregation used in the Ergo blockchain's \\ASDag (Autonomous Script Dataflow Graph) language. The purpose of this code is to optimize the storage and processing of scripts in the blockchain, which is critical for efficient validation of transactions.\n\nThe first section explains the type serialization format used in \\ASDag. Since \\ASDag is a monomorphic IR, concrete types must be specified for some operations. When these operations are serialized, their types must also be serialized. To minimize the number of bytes required for type serialization, a special encoding schema is used. The most frequently used types, such as primitive types, collections of primitive types, and options of primitive types, are represented in an optimized way, preferably by a single byte. For other types, recursive descent down the type tree is used.\n\nThe second section explains the rationale behind constant segregation. In order to validate a transaction, the scripts protecting the input boxes must be executed in the context of the current transaction. This involves several steps, including deserialization of the script into ErgoTree, building cost and calc graphs, and evaluating the cost and data size limits. To optimize script evaluation, the compiled calcGraph can be cached in a map, using the script as a key. However, constants embedded in the script body can cause identical scripts to serialize to different byte arrays, making caching difficult. To solve this problem, constants are replaced with indexed placeholders, and the constants are extracted into a separate array. The serialized script contains the number of constants, the constants collection, and the script expression with placeholders. This allows the script expression part to be used as a key in the cache, and the placeholders can be bound with actual values from the constants collection before evaluation.\n\nOverall, this code demonstrates the importance of optimizing script storage and processing in the Ergo blockchain, and the clever techniques used to achieve this optimization.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the Type Serialization format and how does it work?\n- The Type Serialization format is designed to minimize the number of bytes required to represent a type in the serialization format of \\ASDag. It uses a special encoding schema to save bytes for the types that are used more often, while other types are serialized using recursive descent down the type tree.\n\n2. Why is Constant Segregation important for massive script validation?\n- Constant Segregation is important for massive script validation because it allows for the caching of compiled calcGraphs, which can significantly improve script evaluation performance. However, constants embedded in contracts can cause issues with caching, which is why the solution is to replace each constant with an indexed placeholder.\n\n3. How does the Constant-less ErgoTree format work?\n- The Constant-less ErgoTree format replaces constants in the body of \\ASDag with indexed placeholders. The constants are extracted and serialized separately, while the script expression is serialized with placeholders. This allows for the use of script expression as a key in the cache, and the binding of placeholders with actual values taken from the constants collection before executing the script.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/docs/spec/appendix_motivation.md"}}],["88",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/docs/spec/appendix_predeftypes.tex)\n\nThis code defines the predefined types used in the \\langname programming language.

Rule (2) specifies that a let binding can be reduced by substituting the bound value for the bound variable in the body of the let expression. Rule (3) specifies that an if-then-else expression can be reduced by evaluating the first branch if the condition is true, or the second branch otherwise.

The rules cover various language constructs such as constants, variables, tuples, method calls, functions, if statements, and block expressions.\n\nThe `Const` rule states that a constant has a type that is determined by its value. For example, the constant `5` has type `Int`.\n\nThe `Var` rule states that a variable has the type that is assigned to it in the context. For example, if `x` is assigned the type `Int` in the context, then the variable `x` has type `Int`.\n\nThe `Tuple` rule states that a tuple has a type that is a tuple of the types of its elements. For example, if `(1, \"hello\")` is a tuple of type `(Int, String)`.\n\nThe `MethodCall` rule states that the type of a method call is determined by the method's signature and the types of its arguments. For example, if `m` is a method that takes an `Int` and a `String` and returns a `Boolean`, then `m(5, \"hello\")` has type `Boolean`.\n\nThe `FuncExpr` rule states that a function expression has a type that is a function type. The function type takes the types of the function's arguments and returns the type of the function's body. For example, if `f(x: Int, y: String) = x + y.length`, then `f` has type `(Int, String) -> Int`.\n\nThe `Apply` rule states that the type of a function application is determined by the function's type and the types of its arguments. For example, if `f` is a function of type `(Int, String) -> Int` and `x` is an `Int` and `y` is a `String`, then `f(x, y)` has type `Int`.\n\nThe `If` rule states that the type of an if statement is the type of its branches. For example, if `x` is an `Int` and `y` is a `String`, then `if (x > 0) x else y` has type `Any`, which is the common supertype of `Int` and `String`.\n\nThe `BlockExpr` rule states that the type of a block expression is the type of its last expression. For example, if `x` is an `Int` and `y` is a `String`, then `{ val z = x + y.length; z }` has type `Int`.\n\nThese rules are used to statically type check expressions in a larger project. The type system ensures that expressions are well-typed before they are executed, which can help catch errors early in the development process.

This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the proposition is proven or not.\n\nBoth of these methods are useful for verifying the validity of transactions in the Ergo blockchain. The propBytes method can be used to obtain the serialized bytes of a signature for verification, while the isProven method can be used to verify that a signature is valid. These methods are part of the larger project of creating a secure and efficient blockchain platform. \n\nExample usage of the propBytes method:\n\n```\nval sigProp = new SigmaProp(...)\nval bytes = sigProp.propBytes\n// use bytes for verification\n```\n\nExample usage of the isProven method:\n\n```\nval sigProp = new SigmaProp(...)\nval isVerified = sigProp.isProven\n// use isVerified to determine validity of signature\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The operations are identified by their OpCode, which is a code that specifies the operation to be performed. The operations documented in this file are ByIndex, EQ, Tuple, and Fold.\n\nThe ByIndex operation retrieves a value from a collection by its index. The input slot specifies the collection, and the optional default slot specifies a default value to return if the index is out of range. The tag slot is a byte that indicates whether the default value is present. If the tag is 1, the value slot specifies the default value. If the tag is 0, there is no default value.\n\nThe EQ operation compares two values for equality. The left and right slots specify the values to be compared. If both values are boolean constants, the opCode slot specifies a concrete collection boolean constant code. Otherwise, the left and right values are compared directly.\n\nThe Tuple operation creates a tuple from a list of values. The numItems slot specifies the number of items in the tuple, and the item slot specifies each item in turn.\n\nThe Fold operation applies a binary operator to a collection of values to reduce it to a single value. The this slot specifies the collection, the zero slot specifies a starting value, and the op slot specifies the binary operator to apply. The operator is applied to the starting value and the first element of the collection, then to the result and the second element, and so on until all elements have been processed.\n\nThese operations are low-level building blocks that can be used to implement more complex functionality in the project.

The purpose of this code is to provide a specification for the syntax and semantics of ErgoScript, which can be used in the larger project to implement the language.\n\nThe abstract syntax of ErgoScript is defined using notation shown in Figure 1, which corresponds to the ErgoTree data structure that can be serialized to an array of bytes. The mnemonics shown in the figure correspond to classes of the ErgoTree reference implementation.\n\nThe code assigns types to the terms in a standard way following typing rules shown in Figure 2. Constants keep both the type and the data value of that type. Variables are always typed and identified by unique id, which refers to either lambda-bound variable of val-bound variable. Lambda expressions can take a list of lambda-bound variables which can be used in the body expression, which can be a block expression. Function application takes an expression of functional type and a list of arguments. Method invocation allows to apply functions defined as methods of interface types.\n\nConditional expressions of ErgoScript are strict in condition and lazy in both of the branches. Block expression contains a list of val definitions of variables. Each subsequent definition can only refer to the previously defined variables. Each type may be associated with a list of method declarations, in which case we say that the type has methods. The semantics of the methods is the same as in Java.\n\nThe semantics of ErgoScript is specified by translating all its terms to a lower and simplified language, which is called core language. This lowering translation is shown in Figure 3. All n-ary lambdas when n>1 are transformed to single arguments lambdas using tupled arguments. Logical operations of ErgoScript, which are lazy on second argument, are translated to if term of ErgoScript, which is recursively translated to the corresponding core language term. Syntactic blocks of ErgoScript are completely eliminated and translated to nested lambda expressions, which unambiguously specify evaluation semantics of blocks.

The serialization process converts terms of the language into a binary format, which can be stored in the Ergo blockchain as Box.propositionBytes. When validating the guarding script of an input box of a transaction, the propositionBytes array is deserialized to an \\langname Intermediate Representation (IR) called \\ASDag, which can be evaluated as specified in the code.\n\nThe serialization procedure is specified in general, with the serialization format of \\langname terms and types detailed in the corresponding appendices.

Pseudo-language operators like \\lst{for, match, if, optional} are used to express complex serialization logic and specify the structure of simple serialization slots. Each slot represents a fragment of the serialized byte stream, while operators specify how the slots are combined to form the byte stream.\n\nThe code also covers the serialization of data values, constants, expressions, and \\ASDag instances.

The code defines the distribution of type codes, encoding of data types, encoding of function types, and recursive descent. \n\nThe distribution of type codes is divided into three intervals. The first interval is a special value to represent undefined type, the second interval includes data types such as primitive types, arrays, options, and classes, and the third interval includes function types. The encoding of data types is defined for primitive types and type constructors like Coll or Option. Each primitive type has an id in a range of 1 to 11. For each type constructor, a base code is associated, which is a multiple of 12. The base code can be added to the primitive type id to produce the code of the constructed type. The encoding of function types uses 12 different values for both domain and range types of functions. Each code in the range of function types can be represented as D * 12 + R + 112, where D and R are indices of domain and range types, and 112 is the first code in the interval of function types. \n\nRecursive descent is used when an argument of a type constructor is not a primitive type. In such a case, the special code for the type constructor is emitted according to the table, and recursive descent is performed to every child node of the type tree.

The function `ptype` returns a type of primitive operation specialized for concrete types of its arguments. For example, `ptype(+,\\lst{Int}, \\lst{Int}) = (\\lst{Int}, \\lst{Int}) \\to \\lst{Int}`.\n\nSimilarly, the function `mtype` returns a type of method specialized for concrete types of the arguments of the `MethodCall` term.\n\nThe `BlockExpr` rule defines a type of well-formed block expression. It assumes a total ordering on `val` definitions. If a block expression is not well-formed, then it cannot be typed and evaluated.\n\nOverall, this code is an essential part of the `langname` language, as it ensures that every term has a type and can be evaluated properly.

If a match is found, the method applies the corresponding rewrite rule to the node.\n\nThe trait also provides two other methods called rewriteUnOp and rewriteBinOp, which are used to rewrite unary and binary operations, respectively. These methods take an operation and its arguments and rewrite them to an equivalent expression.

The purpose of this trait is to provide base classes for various descriptors. The \"Entities\" trait extends another trait called \"TypeDescs\" and requires that any class that uses it also extends the \"Scalan\" trait.\n\nThe \"Entities\" trait defines several abstract classes and traits. The \"EntityElem\" abstract class is the base class for all descriptors of staged traits. It has a type parameter \"A\" which represents the type of the staged trait. The \"EntityElem\" class also has a method called \"convert\" which takes a reference to a \"Def\" object and returns a reference to an object of type \"A\". However, this method is not implemented and throws an exception if called. The \"EntityElem\" class also has methods for getting the parent type in the inheritance hierarchy and the name of the entity type without the \"Elem\" suffix.\n\nThe \"EntityElem1\" abstract class is the base class for all descriptors of staged traits with one type parameter. It extends the \"EntityElem\" class and has two type parameters: \"A\" which represents the type of the staged trait, and \"To\" which represents the type of the staged trait with the type parameter applied. The \"EntityElem1\" class also has a constructor that takes an \"Elem\" object representing the type parameter and a \"Cont\" object representing the container type. The \"EntityElem1\" class overrides the \"getName\" method to include the name of the type parameter in the entity name.\n\nThe \"ConcreteElem\" trait is the base class for all descriptors of staged classes. It extends the \"EntityElem\" class and has two type parameters: \"TData\" which represents the data type of the staged class, and \"TClass\" which represents the type of the staged class.\n\nThe \"ConcreteElem1\" trait is the base class for all descriptors of staged classes with one type parameter. It extends the \"EntityElem1\" class and has four type parameters: \"A\" which represents the type of the staged class, \"TData\" which represents the data type of the staged class, \"TClass\" which represents the type of the staged class with the type parameter applied, and \"C[_]\" which represents the container type.\n\nThe \"CompanionElem\" abstract class is the base class for all descriptors of staged companions.

This exception can be thrown within a method body to prevent the body from being unfolded. \n\nIn the context of the larger project, this exception can be used in conjunction with a technique called \"staged programming\" to optimize code execution. Staged programming involves breaking down a program into smaller, composable parts that can be optimized and executed separately. \n\nWhen a method is marked as \"staged\", its body is not executed immediately. Instead, a graph is constructed that represents the computation to be performed. This graph can then be optimized and executed at a later time. \n\nThe `DelayInvokeException` class allows a method to be marked as staged, but still be executed immediately if necessary. If the method encounters a situation where it cannot be executed immediately, it can throw a `DelayInvokeException`. The caller can then catch this exception and reify the invocation as a MethodCall graph node. \n\nHere is an example of how this exception might be used in a staged method:\n\n```scala\ndef stagedMethod(x: Int): Int = {\n  if (x < 0) {\n    throw new DelayInvokeException()\n  } else {\n    x * 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if `x` is negative, the method throws a `DelayInvokeException`. The caller can then catch this exception and reify the invocation as a MethodCall graph node. This allows the computation to be optimized and executed at a later time. \n\nOverall, the `DelayInvokeException` class plays an important role in enabling staged programming and optimizing code execution in the larger project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

These registrations are used to enable reflection, which allows the program to inspect and interact with its own structure at runtime. This can be useful for tasks such as serialization, code generation, or dynamic method invocation.\n\nThe code registers classes and their associated methods and constructors using the `registerClassEntry` function. For example, the `wrappers.scala.WOptions#WOption[_]` class is registered with several methods, such as `filter`, `get`, `isDefined`, `getOrElse`, and `map`. Each method registration includes a lambda function that defines the method's behavior when invoked.\n\nOther classes registered in this file include `TypeDescs#FuncElem[_,_]`, `TypeDescs#PairElem[_,_]`, `Thunks#ThunkElem[_]`, `special.sigma.SigmaDsl#SigmaProp`, `SigmaDsl#BigInt`, `Colls#CollBuilder`, `Colls#Coll[_]`, `SigmaDsl#AvlTree`, `SigmaDsl#Box`, `SigmaDsl#Context`, `SigmaDsl#GroupElement`, `SigmaDsl#Header`, `SigmaDsl#PreHeader`, `SigmaDsl#SigmaDslBuilder`, `WRTypes#WRType[_]`, and several others.\n\nFor example, the `SigmaDsl#BigInt` class is registered with methods like `add`, `max`, `min`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `mod`, and `divide`. These methods are implemented using lambda functions that take the object and arguments as input and perform the corresponding operations.\n\nIn summary, the `GraphIRReflection` object is a central registry for classes, methods, and constructors in the project. It enables reflection capabilities, allowing the program to inspect and interact with its own structure at runtime. This can be useful for tasks such as serialization, code generation, or dynamic method invocation.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\n\n   This code is a part of the Scala project and provides reflection and registration of various classes and methods related to the SigmaDsl, Colls, and other related classes. It helps in registering methods and constructors for these classes, which can be used for dynamic invocation and type checking.\n\n2. **What is the role of the `registerClassEntry` function?**\n\n   The `registerClassEntry` function is used to register a class along with its methods and constructors. This registration helps in providing a way to dynamically invoke methods and constructors for the registered classes, which can be useful for reflection and type checking purposes.\n\n3. **Why are there null type casts for `ctx` in some parts of the code?**\n\n   The null type casts for `ctx` are used to indicate that the value of `ctx` is not important at runtime, but its type is important at the type level.

It also extends `WrappersModule` and `CollsModule`, which provide functionality for working with wrapped types and collections, respectively. \n\nThe trait defines a few type aliases and private variables, as well as a few implicit conversions. One of the implicit conversions is for lifting an `Elem[T]` to a `Ref[WRType[T]]`. This conversion is memoized using a `MemoizedFunc` to improve performance. \n\nThe trait also defines a lazy reference to a `WSpecialPredefCompanionCtor` object, which is used to provide special definitions for certain types and operations. The `specialPredef` method returns this reference. \n\nThe trait overrides the `onReset` method to reset the `_specialPredef` and `_liftElemMemo` variables when the trait is reset. \n\nThe trait defines a few objects that are used for pattern matching and rewriting definitions. These objects are used to apply certain rules to simplify expressions. For example, the `IsNumericToInt` and `IsNumericToLong` objects are used to match certain definitions and extract the argument if it matches the pattern. \n\nThe trait also overrides the `rewriteDef` method to apply certain rules to simplify expressions. For example, it simplifies expressions involving `map`, `length`, and `getOrElse`. \n\nFinally, the trait overrides the `invokeUnlifted` method to modify method calls for collections.

The trait defines three case classes: `MethodCall`, `NewObject`, and `InvokeResult`. \n\n`MethodCall` represents a node in the computation graph that represents the invocation of a method on an object. It contains information about the receiver object, the method being called, the arguments passed to the method, and the type of the result. The `tryInvoke` method attempts to invoke the method on the receiver object and returns an `InvokeResult` object indicating whether the invocation was successful or not. The `mkMethodCall` method creates a new `MethodCall` node and returns its reference.\n\n`NewObject` represents a node in the computation graph that creates a new object of a given class using the constructor with the specified arguments. The `newObjEx` method creates a new `NewObject` node and returns its reference.\n\n`InvokeResult` is an abstract class that represents the result of a method invocation. It has three subclasses: `InvokeSuccess`, `InvokeFailure`, and `InvokeImpossible`. `InvokeSuccess` represents a successful invocation with the result value, `InvokeFailure` represents a failed invocation with the exception that was thrown, and `InvokeImpossible` represents an invocation that is not possible, for example, when the receiver object does not implement the method being called.\n\nThe `MethodCalls` trait also defines several helper methods for invoking methods on objects, checking if a method can be invoked on an object, and creating delegate instances for method invocation.

It is a key component of the Scalan framework and is used extensively throughout the project.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `MethodCalls` trait and how is it used in the project?\n- The `MethodCalls` trait defines methods and classes for representing and invoking method calls in the project. It is used as a mixin trait in the `Scalan` trait, which provides a domain-specific language for defining and manipulating data structures and operations.\n\n2. What is the `MethodCall` case class and what information does it contain?\n- The `MethodCall` case class represents a method call on an instance of a class, and contains the receiver node reference, the method descriptor, the argument node references, a flag indicating if the method can never be invoked, the result type descriptor, and a flag indicating if the method call was created by a generated adapter class.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `invokeMethod` method and what are its parameters?\n- The `invokeMethod` method is a generic helper method for invoking a method on a receiver node with the given arguments. Its parameters are the receiver node reference, the method descriptor, the argument array, and three functions to handle the success, exception, and impossible cases of the method invocation. It checks if the method can be invoked on the receiver node and catches any exceptions thrown during the invocation.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/MethodCalls.md"}}],["138",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/ModuleInfo.scala)\n\nThe code above defines a case class called `ModuleInfo` that contains information about a generated Special library module. This class is used in the generated code and is created to provide information about the module's package name, module name, and file extension. \n\nThe `ModuleInfo` class takes three parameters: `packageName`, `moduleName`, and `extension`. The `packageName` parameter is a string that represents the name of the package that the module belongs to. The `moduleName` parameter is a string that represents the name of the module. The `extension` parameter is an optional string that represents the file extension of the module. By default, the file extension is set to \".scalan\".\n\nThe `ModuleInfo` class has three methods: `name`, `getKey`, and `sourceFileName`. The `name` method returns an instance of the `SSymName` class, which is a class that represents a fully qualified name of a symbol. The `getKey` method returns the fully qualified name of the module.

What is the purpose of the `getKey` and `sourceFileName` methods in the `ModuleInfo` class?\n   - The `getKey` method returns the fully qualified name of the module as a string, while the `sourceFileName` method returns the file path of the module's source file based on its package and module names.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/ModuleInfo.md"}}],["139",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/Modules.scala)\n\nThe code above is a trait called \"Modules\" that extends another trait called \"Base\" and is used in the larger project called \"Scalan\". The purpose of this trait is to provide functionality related to registering staged modules in the cake initialization process.\n\nThe trait has two methods: \"okRegisterModules\" and \"registerModule\". The \"okRegisterModules\" method returns a boolean value indicating whether staged modules should be registered when the cake is constructed and initialized. The default value is false, but it can be overridden in subclasses.\n\nThe \"registerModule\" method is called once for each staged module during the cake initialization process.

If it returns false, an exception is thrown with a message indicating that the \"registerModule\" method needs to be overridden in the subclass.\n\nThis trait can be used in the larger project to provide a way to register staged modules during the cake initialization process. For example, if a new module is added to the project, it can be registered by overriding the \"okRegisterModules\" method to return true and implementing the \"registerModule\" method to handle the registration of the new module.\n\nHere is an example of how this trait can be used:\n\n```scala\ntrait MyModule extends Scalan {\n  override def okRegisterModules: Boolean = true\n\n  override protected def registerModule(moduleInfo: ModuleInfo) = {\n    // handle registration of MyModule here\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a new module called \"MyModule\" is defined as a subclass of \"Scalan\".

The class takes a block of code as a parameter which may execute potentially many times, but only once before each reset. The class has three methods: `value`, `isSet`, and `reset`.\n\nThe `value` method returns the value of the lazy block. If the `_isSet` flag is false, the block is executed and the `_value` variable is set to the result of the block. The `_isSet` flag is then set to true.

For example, if `ml` is a `MutableLazy[Int]`, then `ml + 1` will automatically convert `ml` to its value type `Int` before adding 1.\n\nThis class can be used in a larger project to represent lazy values that need to be reset. For example, it could be used to represent a configuration object that is loaded lazily from a file, but can be reset if the file is updated. The `MutableLazy` class provides a simple and efficient way to implement this behavior.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `@volatile` keyword in this code?\n- The `@volatile` keyword is used to ensure that the `_isSet` variable is always read and written to from main memory, rather than from a thread's cache.\n\n2. Can the `block` parameter be null?\n- Yes, the `block` parameter can be null, but it will throw a `NullPointerException` when accessed.\n\n3.

The class contains several traits that define different operations and functionalities that can be used in the larger project.\n\nThe `Scalan` class is designed using the cake pattern, which allows for the creation of independent instances of the class with different contexts. This means that many instances of the class can be created simultaneously, each with its own independent IR context. The inner types declared in the traits are path-dependent, which means that `ctx1.Ref[_]` and `ctx2.Ref[_]` are different types.\n\nThe typical usage of the `Scalan` class is to create a new instance of the class using `val ctx = new Scalan` and then import inner declarations using `import ctx._`. This way, the declarations will be directly available as if they were global declarations. The cake design pattern also allows for the `override` of many methods and values in classes derived from `Scalan`, which is a significant benefit over the *everything is global* design.\n\nThe `Scalan` class includes several traits that define different operations and functionalities. These traits include `TypeDescs`, `MethodCalls`, `Tuples`, `NumericOps`, `UnBinOps`, `LogicalOps`, `OrderingOps`, `Equal`, `UniversalOps`, `Functions`, `IfThenElse`, `Transforming`, `Thunks`, `Entities`, `Modules`, and `DefRewriting`. Each of these traits defines a set of methods and functionalities that can be used in the larger project.\n\nFor example, the `NumericOps` trait defines methods for performing arithmetic operations on numeric types, such as `plus`, `minus`, `times`, and `div`. The `IfThenElse` trait defines a method for performing conditional operations, such as `ifThenElse`. The `Transforming` trait defines methods for transforming expressions, such as `rewriteDef`, `rewriteAll`, and `rewriteAllWithContext`.

The purpose of this trait is to provide a library of functions and types for working with the Sigma protocol, which is a cryptographic protocol for secure multi-party computation.\n\nThe SigmaDslModule provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing Sigma protocols in a concise and readable way. The WRType object defines a set of types that can be used in the DSL, including AnyElement, which represents any type of element. The wRTypeAnyElement value is an implicit value that provides a default type for elements in the DSL.\n\nThe sigmaDslBuilder method returns a reference to a SigmaDslBuilder object, which is used to build Sigma protocols using the DSL. This method is used during compilation to represent a global value called Global, which is used in the Sigma protocol.\n\nOverall, this code provides a foundation for working with the Sigma protocol in a Scala project.

Type descriptors are used to represent the types of staged values and functions in the Scalan IR. The main classes in this module are `Elem`, `Cont`, and their subclasses.\n\n`Elem[A]` is an abstract class representing a type descriptor for a staged type `A`. It provides methods for working with type arguments, lifting and unlifting types, and invoking methods on source types. There are several concrete subclasses of `Elem`, such as `BaseElem`, `PairElem`, `SumElem`, and `FuncElem`, which represent different kinds of staged types.\n\n`Cont[F[_]]` is an abstract class representing a type constructor of kind `* -> *`. It provides methods for lifting and unlifting type descriptors, as well as recognizing type descriptors constructed by the type constructor. The `Functor[F[_]]` trait extends `Cont[F[_]]` and adds a `map` method for mapping over the elements of a container type.\n\nThe module also provides several utility methods and implicit conversions for working with type descriptors. For example, `pairElement`, `sumElement`, and `funcElement` methods create type descriptors for pairs, sums, and functions, respectively. The `toLazyElem` method converts an `Elem[A]` to a lazy `LElem[A]`. The `invokeUnlifted` method is used to invoke a source type method corresponding to a given `MethodCall` node in the Scalan IR.\n\nIn summary, the `TypeDescs` module is an essential part of the Scalan framework, providing the necessary abstractions and utilities for working with type descriptors in the staged computation setting.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `TypeDescs` abstract class?**\n\n   The `TypeDescs` abstract class is used to define various type descriptors and related utility methods for working with types in the Scalan project.

The `ELSE` method returns the result of the if-then-else expression.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `IfThenElseLazy` case class and how is it used in the `ifThenElseLazy` method?\n   \n   The `IfThenElseLazy` case class represents an if-then-else expression with lazy evaluation of branches. It is used in the `ifThenElseLazy` method to construct an IR node that wraps the \"then\" and \"else\" branches in `ThunkDef` nodes, which are evaluated lazily.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/primitives/IfThenElse.md"}}],["149",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/primitives/LogicalOps.scala)\n\nThe `LogicalOps` trait is a part of the Scalan project and provides definitions for logical operations in Scala. The trait extends the `Base` trait and requires the `Scalan` trait to be mixed in. The trait defines several logical operations, including AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, as well as a Boolean to Int conversion operation. \n\nThe `And`, `Or`, `Not`, and `BinaryXorOp` operations are defined as instances of the `EndoBinOp` and `EndoUnOp` classes, which represent endomorphic binary and unary operations, respectively. These operations are defined using the `applySeq` method, which takes two or one Boolean arguments and returns the result of the logical operation. \n\nThe `BooleanToInt` operation is defined as an instance of the `UnOp` class, which represents a unary operation that takes a Boolean argument and returns an Int. The `applySeq` method of this operation returns 1 if the Boolean argument is true and 0 otherwise. \n\nThe `RepBooleanOps` class provides extension methods for `Ref[Boolean]`, which is a reference to a Boolean value. These methods allow for the use of the logical operations defined in the `LogicalOps` trait on `Ref[Boolean]` values. For example, the `&&` method takes a `Ref[Boolean]` argument and returns the result of the AND operation between the `Ref[Boolean]` value and the argument. \n\nThe `rewriteBoolConsts` method is a helper method that defines rewriting rules with boolean constants. It takes four functions as arguments: `ifTrue`, `ifFalse`, `ifEqual`, and `ifNegated`. These functions are called with a `Sym` argument, which represents a symbolic expression, and return a `Sym` that represents the result of the rewriting rule. The method checks the structure of the `lhs` and `rhs` arguments and applies the appropriate rewriting rule based on the structure. \n\nOverall, the `LogicalOps` trait provides a set of logical operations that can be used in the larger Scalan project. The `RepBooleanOps` class provides extension methods that allow for the use of these operations on `Ref[Boolean]` values. The `rewriteBoolConsts` method is a helper method that defines rewriting rules with boolean constants.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this code is to provide a set of common numeric operations that can be used across the project. \n\nThe `NumericOpsCls` class defines extension methods for `Ref[T]` where `T` is an instance of `ExactNumeric`. These methods include addition, subtraction, multiplication, unary negation, and conversion to `Int` and `Long`. These methods are implemented using descriptors defined in the trait. For example, the `+` method is implemented using the `NumericPlus` descriptor, which takes an instance of `ExactNumeric[T]` and returns an `EndoBinOp[T]` that applies the `plus` method of the `ExactNumeric` instance to its arguments. \n\nThe `IntegralOpsCls` class defines extension methods for `Ref[T]` where `T` is an instance of `ExactIntegral`. These methods include division, modulo, and an alternative division operator `/!`. These methods are implemented using descriptors defined in the trait. For example, the `div` method is implemented using the `IntegralDivide` descriptor, which takes an instance of `ExactIntegral[T]` and returns a `DivOp[T]` that applies the `quot` method of the `ExactIntegral` instance to its arguments. \n\nThe `numeric` and `integral` methods return instances of `ExactNumeric[T]` and `ExactIntegral[T]`, respectively, for a given type `T`. These methods are implemented using the `implicitly` keyword to retrieve the appropriate type-class instance for `T`. \n\nThe descriptors for binary operations (`NumericPlus`, `NumericMinus`, `NumericTimes`, `IntegralDivide`, and `IntegralMod`) are defined as case classes that extend `EndoBinOp[T]` or `DivOp[T]`. These descriptors take an instance of `ExactNumeric[T]` or `ExactIntegral[T]` and return a function that applies the appropriate method of the type-class instance to its arguments. \n\nThe `NumericNegate`, `NumericToInt`, and `NumericToLong` descriptors are defined as case classes that extend `UnOp[T, R]`. These descriptors take an instance of `ExactNumeric[T]` and return a function that applies the appropriate method of the type-class instance to its argument. \n\nFinally, the `isZero` and `isOne` methods are defined as inline functions that compare a given value with the zero or one of an instance of `ExactNumeric[T]`. \n\nOverall, this code provides a set of common numeric operations that can be used across the project, making it easier to write and maintain code that involves numeric calculations. For example, if a function needs to perform a division operation on a type that implements `ExactIntegral`, it can simply call the `div` method on a `Ref[T]` instance, rather than having to write its own division logic.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `OrderingOpsCls[T]` class provides the extension methods for comparison operations such as `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `max`, `min`, and `compare`. \n\nThe `OrderingLT`, `OrderingLTEQ`, `OrderingGT`, `OrderingGTEQ`, `OrderingMax`, `OrderingMin`, and `OrderingCompare` classes are descriptors for the binary operations `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `max`, `min`, and `compare`, respectively. These classes extend the `BinOp` class which is a binary operation descriptor that takes two arguments of type `T` and returns a result of type `R`. The `applySeq` method is overridden in each of these classes to apply the corresponding comparison operation using the `ExactOrdering` instance for type `T`.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to perform comparison operations on types that have an instance of `ExactOrdering`.

Program graphs are used to represent the control flow of a program and are constructed from a set of root symbols. The purpose of this code is to provide functionality for constructing and manipulating program graphs.\n\nThe `ProgramGraphs` trait defines a type called `PGraph`, which is an alias for `ProgramGraph`. It also defines two classes called `PGraphUsages` and `ProgramGraph`. The `PGraphUsages` class is a deboxed function that computes the usages of a given node in a graph. The `ProgramGraph` class is an immutable graph that is collected from `roots` following `Ref.node.deps` links. It takes in a set of root symbols and a filter function that can be used to filter out certain nodes from the graph. The `ProgramGraph` class also provides functionality for mirroring all the nodes of the graph, applying a rewriter, and performing rewriting.\n\nThe `ProgramGraphs` trait also defines an object called `ProgramGraph`. This object provides a method called `transform` that takes in a `Ref` and returns a new `Ref` that has been transformed using a `Rewriter` and a `MapTransformer`. The `transform` method uses the `ProgramGraph` class to construct a program graph from the root symbol and then applies the provided `Rewriter` and `MapTransformer` to the graph.\n\nOverall, the `ProgramGraphs` trait provides functionality for constructing and manipulating program graphs. It can be used in the larger project to represent the control flow of a program and to perform transformations on the program graph. Below is an example of how the `ProgramGraph` object can be used to transform a `Ref`:\n\n```\nval s: Ref[Int] = ...\nval rw: Rewriter = ...\nval t: MapTransformer = ...\nval transformedS = ProgramGraph.transform(s, rw, t)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `PGraphUsages` class?\n- The `PGraphUsages` class is a deboxed function that computes the usages of a given node in the reversed graph `g`.\n\n2. What is the difference between `ProgramGraph` constructors?\n- The `ProgramGraph` class has three constructors: one that takes a sequence of `Sym` roots and a `Nullable` transformer and filter node, one that takes a sequence of `Sym` roots and a `Nullable` filter node, and one that takes a single `Sym` root. The difference between them is the presence or absence of a transformer and filter node.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `transform` method in the `ProgramGraph` class?\n- The `transform` method mirrors all the nodes of the graph using a given mirror instance and transformer, and performs rewriting using a given rewriter. It returns a new graph that is semantically equivalent to the original graph, but may not be a clone of it.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/staged/ProgramGraphs.md"}}],["159",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/staged/Transforming.scala)\n\nThe code defines a set of traits and classes that are used in the Scalan project for compiler passes, graph transformations, and graph mirroring. The main purpose of this code is to provide a framework for defining and executing compiler passes on a graph of computations. \n\nThe `Pass` trait defines a compiler pass, which has a name, configuration parameters, and finalization logic. The `PassConfig` case class defines the configuration parameters for a pass, such as whether to specialize tuple types or turn on constant propagation. The `DefaultPass` class is a concrete implementation of the `Pass` trait that can be used as a default pass when no other pass is specified. \n\nThe `Transformer` trait defines a graph transformation that maps nodes in a graph to new nodes. The `Rewriter` trait defines a set of rewriting rules that can be applied to a graph. The `Mirror` trait defines a mirror of a graph node, which provides default implementations for mirroring variables, lambdas, and thunks. \n\nThe `MapTransformer` class is a concrete implementation of the `Transformer` trait that uses a hash map to store the mapping between nodes in the original graph and nodes in the transformed graph. The `PartialRewriter` class is an implicit class that turns a partial function into a `Rewriter`. The `NoRewriting` object is a `Rewriter` that does not change the graph when applied. \n\nThe `beginPass` and `endPass` methods are used to set the current pass for the graph and finalize the current pass, respectively. The `mirrorNode` method is used to mirror a node in the graph, which creates a new node in the transformed graph. The `mirrorSymbols` method is used to mirror a set of nodes in the graph. \n\nOverall, this code provides a framework for defining and executing compiler passes on a graph of computations. It allows for graph transformations and mirroring, which can be used to optimize and analyze the graph.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Pass` trait and its subclasses?\n- The `Pass` trait and its subclasses define a compiler pass with a unique name, configuration parameters, and finalization logic. The compiler can be configured to perform one pass after another.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Rewriter` trait and its subclasses?\n- The `Rewriter` trait and its subclasses define a set of rewriting rules that can be applied to a graph of nodes. The `PartialRewriter` class turns a partial function into a rewriter.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Mirror` trait and its subclasses?\n- The `Mirror` trait and its subclasses provide default implementations for mirroring graph nodes. Mirroring is the process of creating a new graph that is equivalent to the original graph, but with different nodes. The `DefaultMirror` instance is used in core IR methods.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/staged/Transforming.md"}}],["160",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/.autodoc/docs/json/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/staged)\n\nThe code in the `.autodoc/docs/json/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/staged` folder provides functionality for working with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of nodes, representing program graphs and control flow, and performing compiler passes, graph transformations, and graph mirroring. This functionality is essential for optimizing and analyzing the graph in the larger Scalan project.\n\nIn `AstGraphs.scala`, the `AstGraphs` trait provides tools for working with DAGs in a functional programming context. It defines several classes and types, such as `AstGraph`, `GraphNode`, `Schedule`, and `ScheduleIds`, for representing and manipulating DAGs. The code also includes methods for building usage maps, flattening schedules, and checking for multiple usages of nodes in the DAG.\n\nFor example, you can create a new `AstGraph` object and manipulate its schedule:\n\n```scala\nval graph = new AstGraph(...)\nval flattenedSchedule = graph.flattenSchedule\n```\n\nIn `ProgramGraphs.scala`, the `ProgramGraphs` trait extends `AstGraphs` and focuses on constructing and manipulating program graphs, which represent the control flow of a program. It defines the `PGraph`, `PGraphUsages`, and `ProgramGraph` classes, as well as the `ProgramGraph` object, which provides a `transform` method for transforming a `Ref` using a `Rewriter` and a `MapTransformer`.\n\nHere's an example of using the `ProgramGraph` object to transform a `Ref`:\n\n```scala\nval s: Ref[Int] = ...\nval rw: Rewriter = ...\nval t: MapTransformer = ...\nval transformedS = ProgramGraph.transform(s, rw, t)\n```\n\nIn `Transforming.scala`, the code provides a framework for defining and executing compiler passes on a graph of computations. It defines traits like `Pass`, `Transformer`, `Rewriter`, and `Mirror`, as well as classes like `PassConfig`, `DefaultPass`, `MapTransformer`, `PartialRewriter`, and the `NoRewriting` object. The code also includes methods like `beginPass`, `endPass`, `mirrorNode`, and `mirrorSymbols` for managing compiler passes and graph transformations.\n\nFor example, you can define a custom compiler pass and apply it to a graph:\n\n```scala\nobject MyPass extends Pass {\n  val name = \"MyPass\"\n  ...\n}\n\nval graph = ...\ngraph.beginPass(MyPass)\nval transformedGraph = graph.mirrorSymbols(...)\ngraph.endPass()\n```\n\nOverall, the code in this folder is essential for working with DAGs, program graphs, and compiler passes in the Scalan project.

The framework is designed to optimize and analyze program graphs, perform compiler passes, and enable staged programming.\n\nFor example, the `DefRewriting` trait provides methods for rewriting nodes in a graph, which can be used to optimize the graph and improve the performance of the program. The `Entities` trait provides base classes for various descriptors of staged traits and classes, allowing developers to create specific descriptors for different types of staged traits and classes.\n\nThe `Exceptions` module defines a custom exception class called `DelayInvokeException`, which can be used in conjunction with staged programming to optimize code execution. The `GraphIRReflection` object registers classes, methods, and constructors, enabling reflection capabilities for tasks such as serialization, code generation, or dynamic method invocation.\n\nThe `Library` trait provides a set of common functionality and utilities that can be used across the larger project, such as simplifying expressions and modifying method calls for collections. The `MethodCalls` trait provides functionality for creating and invoking method calls in a graph-based representation of computations.\n\nThe `SigmaLibrary` trait provides a library of functions and types for working with the Sigma protocol, a cryptographic protocol for secure multi-party computation. The `TypeDescs` module provides a set of classes and methods for working with type descriptors in the Scalan framework, representing the types of staged values and functions in the Scalan IR.\n\nHere's an example of how some of these traits can be used together:\n\n```scala\nimport scalan._\nimport scalan.primitives._\n\ntrait MyModule extends Scalan with NumericOps with OrderingOps with Tuples {\n  def myFunction[A: ExactNumeric: ExactOrdering](a: Ref[A], b: Ref[A]): Ref[(A, A)] = {\n    val sum = a + b\n    val max = a.max(b)\n    val tuple = Pair(sum, max)\n    tuple\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a function `myFunction` that takes two values of type `A`, where `A` has instances of `ExactNumeric` and `ExactOrdering`. The function calculates the sum and maximum of the two values and returns a tuple containing the results. The `NumericOps` and `OrderingOps` traits provide the necessary operations for performing these calculations, while the `Tuples` trait provides support for working with tuples.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/summary.md"}}],["162",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/util/Variance.scala)\n\nThis code defines a sealed trait called \"Variance\" and three case objects that extend it: \"Invariant\", \"Covariant\", and \"Contravariant\". \n\nIn programming, variance refers to how subtyping between types relates to subtyping between their generic types. In other words, it determines how the subtyping of a generic type is affected by the subtyping of its type parameters. \n\nThe \"Invariant\" case object represents a type parameter that is not affected by subtyping. This means that a value of type A cannot be substituted for a value of type B, even if A is a subtype of B. \n\nThe \"Covariant\" case object represents a type parameter that is affected by subtyping in a positive way.

This means that if A is a subtype of B, then a value of type F[B] is a subtype of F[A]. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to define the variance of type parameters in generic classes and functions.

These functions and types might be commonly used across different parts of the project, and having them in a centralized module makes it easier for developers to access and use them.\n\n2. **WOptionsModule**: This module provides a set of wrappers for working with Scala's `Option` type. The `Option` type is used to handle null values in a safe and functional way. By providing wrappers for this type, the module makes it easier for developers to work with `Option` values in their code.

The code then demonstrates how these wrappers and utilities can be used to work with special pre-defined functions, handle null values using `Option`, and work with specific types using type wrappers.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/graph-ir/src/main/scala/special/wrappers/summary.md"}}],["175",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/.autodoc/docs/json/graph-ir/src/main/scala)\n\nThe code in the `.autodoc/docs/json/graph-ir/src/main/scala` folder is part of a larger project that utilizes the Scalan framework for optimizing and compiling custom collection types and operations, as well as providing essential building blocks for creating complex smart contracts on the blockchain using the Sigma language.\n\nIn the `scalan` folder, the code provides a set of traits, classes, and utilities for working with the Scalan framework, a domain-specific language for high-performance computing.

This trait defines another trait called WOption, which represents an optional value that may or may not be present. The purpose of this code is to provide a wrapper around Scala's Option type, which allows for more convenient and expressive manipulation of optional values.\n\nThe WOption trait has several methods that can be used to manipulate optional values. The isDefined method returns a boolean indicating whether the value is present or not. The filter method takes a function that returns a boolean and returns a new WOption that contains the value if the function returns true, or None if it returns false. The map method takes a function that transforms the value and returns a new WOption containing the transformed value. The getOrElse method returns the value if it is present, or a default value if it is not. Finally, the get method returns the value if it is present, or throws an exception if it is not.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to simplify the handling of optional values. For example, instead of using if statements to check if a value is present and then accessing it, the WOption methods can be used to perform these operations in a more concise and expressive way.

The filter method is used to create a new optional value that contains the original value only if it is greater than zero. The map method is used to create a new optional value that contains the original value multiplied by two. The getOrElse method is used to get the value if it is present, or return 42 if it is not. By using these methods, the code is more concise and easier to read than if statements or other conditional logic.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This wrapper provides more convenient and expressive manipulation of optional values through the `WOption` trait. The `WOption` trait contains several methods for handling optional values, such as `isDefined`, `filter`, `map`, `getOrElse`, and `get`.\n\nFor instance, consider the following example:\n\n```scala\nval opt: WOption[Int] = ...\nval filtered = opt.filter(x => x > 0)\nval doubled = opt.map(x => x * 2)\nval value = opt.getOrElse(42)\n```\n\nIn this example, `opt` is an optional integer value. The `filter` method creates a new optional value containing the original value only if it is greater than zero. The `map` method creates a new optional value containing the original value multiplied by two. The `getOrElse` method returns the value if it is present or 42 if it is not. By using these methods, the code becomes more concise and easier to read than using if statements or other conditional logic.\n\nThe `impl` subfolder contains the `WOptionsImpl.scala` file, which provides the implementation for the `WOption` trait.

The `CryptoFacadeJs` object provides various cryptographic functions, such as normalizing points, negating points, multiplying points, and adding points. The `Point` object provides methods for working with elliptic curve points, and the `utils` object provides utility functions for working with byte arrays and hex strings.\n\nIn `Platform.scala`, the `Platform` object provides a JVM-specific implementation of various cryptographic methods used in the larger project. It contains several methods for working with elliptic curve points and field elements, such as getting the x and y coordinates of a point, encoding a field element, and multiplying two points together. The `Platform` object also contains methods for working with byte arrays and JavaScript typed arrays, cryptographic contexts, random number generation, and hashing.\n\nHere's an example of how this code might be used:\n\n```scala\nimport sigmastate.crypto._\n\n// Create a new cryptographic context\nval cryptoContext = CryptoFacadeJs.createCryptoContext()\n\n// Get the generator point of the elliptic curve\nval generator = cryptoContext.getGenerator()\n\n// Multiply the generator point by a scalar\nval scalar = BigInt(\"1234567890\")\nval result = CryptoFacadeJs.multiplyPoint(generator, scalar)\n\n// Add two points together\nval point1 = cryptoContext.decodePoint(\"abcdef\")\nval point2 = cryptoContext.decodePoint(\"123456\")\nval sum = CryptoFacadeJs.addPoint(point1, point2)\n\n// Check if a point is the point at infinity\nval isInfinity = CryptoFacadeJs.isInfinityPoint(sum)\n\n// Perform HMAC-SHA512 hashing\nval data = utils.hexToBytes(\"abcdef\")\nval key = utils.hexToBytes(\"123456\")\nval hash = CryptoFacadeJs.hashHmacSHA512(data, key)\n```\n\nOverall, the code in this folder provides a set of cryptographic functions for working with elliptic curve cryptography in the Sigma protocol.

This algorithm is a type of message authentication code (MAC) that uses a secret key to authenticate a message and ensure its integrity. \n\nThe HmacSHA512 object has a private constant called HashAlgo that specifies the name of the algorithm used for hashing. It also has a public method called hash that takes two parameters: a byte array representing the secret key and a byte array representing the data to be hashed.

It takes a `networkPrefix` parameter to differentiate between mainnet and testnet addresses. The `toString` method converts an `ErgoAddress` to a Base58 string, while the `fromString` method converts a Base58 string to an `ErgoAddress`. The `fromProposition` method converts an `ErgoTree` to the corresponding `ErgoAddress`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimplicit val encoder: ErgoAddressEncoder = ErgoAddressEncoder(ErgoAddressEncoder.MainnetNetworkPrefix)\n\nval p2pkAddress = P2PKAddress(pubkey)\nval p2shAddress = Pay2SHAddress(script)\nval p2sAddress = Pay2SAddress(script)\n\nval p2pkStr = encoder.toString(p2pkAddress)\nval p2shStr = encoder.toString(p2shAddress)\nval p2sStr = encoder.toString(p2sAddress)\n\nval decodedP2pk = encoder.fromString(p2pkStr)\nval decodedP2sh = encoder.fromString(p2shStr)\nval decodedP2s = encoder.fromString(p2sStr)\n```\n\nThis code is essential for handling Ergo addresses in the larger project, as it provides a way to create, encode, and decode addresses for different types of scripts and network configurations.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What are the different address types supported by this code and their semantics?\n   **Answer**: The code supports three address types: Pay-to-PublicKey (P2PK), Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH), and Pay-to-Script (P2S). P2PK addresses correspond to a serialized (compressed) public key, P2SH addresses use the first 192 bits of the Blake2b256 hash of serialized script bytes, and P2S addresses use the serialized script.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the code ensure the integrity of an address?\n   **Answer**: The integrity of an address is ensured by incorporating a checksum. The checksum is calculated using the Blake2b256 hash function on the prefix byte and content bytes of the address.\n\n3. **Question**: What are the possible network types and their corresponding prefix values?\n   **Answer**: There are two possible network types: Mainnet and Testnet. Mainnet has a prefix value of 0x00, and Testnet has a prefix value of 0x10.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/ErgoAddress.md"}}],["210",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/ErgoBox.scala)\n\n# ErgoBox Class\n\nThe `ErgoBox` class represents a box (also known as a coin or an unspent output) in the Ergo blockchain. A box is a state element locked by some proposition (ErgoTree). It is associated with some monetary value (arbitrary, but with predefined precision, so integer arithmetic is used to work with the value), and also a guarding script (aka proposition) to protect the box from unauthorized opening. \n\nIn Ergo, a box is just a collection of registers, some with mandatory types and semantics, others could be used by applications in any way. The `ErgoBox` class adds additional fields in addition to amount and proposition (which are stored in the registers R0 and R1). Namely, register R2 contains additional tokens (a sequence of pairs (token identifier, value)). Register R3 contains height when block got included into the blockchain and also transaction identifier and box index in the transaction outputs. Registers R4-R9 are free for arbitrary usage.\n\nA transaction is unsealing a box. As a box can not be open twice, any further valid transaction can not be linked to the same box.\n\nThe `ErgoBox` class has the following fields:\n- `value`: amount of money associated with the box\n- `ergoTree`: guarding script, which should be evaluated to true in order to open this box\n- `additionalTokens`: secondary tokens the box contains\n- `additionalRegisters`: additional registers the box can carry over\n- `transactionId`: id of transaction which created the box\n- `index`: index of the box (from 0 to total number of boxes the transaction with transactionId created - 1)\n- `creationHeight`: height when a transaction containing the box was created.\n\nThe class has the following methods:\n- `get(identifier: RegisterId)`: returns the value of the register with the given identifier, or None if the register is not found.\n- `toCandidate`: converts this box to `ErgoBoxCandidate` by forgetting transaction reference data (transactionId, index).\n- `equals(arg: Any)`: returns true if the given object is an `ErgoBox` with the same id as this box.\n- `hashCode()`: returns the hash code of the box id.\n- `toString()`: returns a string representation of the box.\n\nThe `ErgoBox` class also has several companion objects:\n- `BoxId`: a type alias for `ADKey`, which is the type of the box id.\n- `TokenId`: a type alias for `Digest32Coll`, which is the type of the token id.\n- `Token`: a tuple of a token id and a long value.\n- `MaxBoxSize`: the maximum size of a box.\n- `STokenType`: the type of a token.\n- `STokensRegType`: the type of the register containing additional tokens.\n- `SReferenceRegType`: the type of the register containing reference to transaction and output id where the box was created.\n- `Amount`: a type alias for `Long`, which is the type of the box value.\n- `RegisterId`: a trait representing a register identifier.\n- `MandatoryRegisterId`: a trait representing a mandatory register identifier.\n- `NonMandatoryRegisterId`: a trait representing a non-mandatory register identifier.\n- `R0`, `R1`, `R2`, `R3`, `R4`, `R5`, `R6`, `R7`, `R8`, `R9`: objects representing register identifiers.\n- `ValueRegId`, `ScriptRegId`, `TokensRegId`, `ReferenceRegId`: objects representing mandatory register identifiers.\n- `MaxTokens`: the maximum number of tokens that can be stored in a box.\n- `maxRegisters`: the maximum number of registers that can be stored in a box.\n- `mandatoryRegisters`: a sequence of mandatory register identifiers.\n- `nonMandatoryRegisters`: a sequence of non-mandatory register identifiers.\n- `startingNonMandatoryIndex`: the index of the first non-mandatory register.\n- `allRegisters`: a sequence of all register identifiers.\n- `registerByName`: a map from register name to register identifier.\n- `registerByIndex(index: Int)`: returns the register identifier with the given index.\n- `findRegisterByIndex(i: Int)`: returns the register identifier with the given index, or None if the index is out of range.\n- `sigmaSerializer`: a serializer for `ErgoBox`.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoBox` class?\n- The `ErgoBox` class represents a box (or coin) in a UTXO-based cryptocurrency, which contains a monetary value, a guarding script, additional tokens, and additional registers.\n\n2. What are the mandatory and non-mandatory registers in an `ErgoBox`?\n- The mandatory registers in an `ErgoBox` are `R0` (monetary value), `R1` (guarding script), `R2` (secondary tokens), and `R3` (reference to transaction and output id where the box was created). The non-mandatory registers are `R4` to `R9`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `sigmaSerializer` object in the `ErgoBox` companion object?\n- The `sigmaSerializer` object is used to serialize and deserialize `ErgoBox` objects to and from bytes, respectively.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/ErgoBox.md"}}],["211",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/ErgoBoxAssets.scala)\n\nThis code defines a trait and a case class that represent the assets held in an ErgoBox, which is a data structure used in the Ergo blockchain platform. The ErgoBoxAssets trait defines two properties: the value of the box (a Long) and a map of tokens (represented by ModifierId and Long). The ErgoBoxAssetsHolder case class implements this trait and provides a constructor that takes a value and a map of tokens. \n\nThe ErgoBoxAssetsHolder object also provides a convenience constructor that takes only a value and creates an empty map of tokens. This can be useful when creating a new ErgoBox that does not initially hold any tokens. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to represent the assets held in an ErgoBox. ErgoBoxes are used to store and transfer value and tokens in the Ergo blockchain, so this code is an important part of the platform's functionality. Developers can use the ErgoBoxAssetsHolder case class to create and manipulate ErgoBoxes in their applications. \n\nFor example, to create a new ErgoBox with a value of 100 and no tokens, a developer could use the following code:\n\n```\nval box = ErgoBoxAssetsHolder(100)\n```\n\nTo create a new ErgoBox with a value of 50 and a token with a modifier ID of \"abc\" and a quantity of 10, a developer could use the following code:\n\n```\nval tokens = Map(ModifierId(\"abc\") -> 10)\nval box = ErgoBoxAssetsHolder(50, tokens)\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and flexible way to represent the assets held in an ErgoBox, which is a key component of the Ergo blockchain platform.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is similar to the `ErgoBox` class, but it does not contain the transaction ID and index, which are calculated after the transaction is formed. \n\nThe class has the following fields:\n- `value`: the amount of money associated with the box.\n- `ergoTree`: the guarding script, which should be evaluated to true in order to open this box.\n- `creationHeight`: the height when a transaction containing the box was created. This height is declared by the user and should not exceed the height of the block containing the transaction with this box.\n- `additionalTokens`: secondary tokens the box contains.\n- `additionalRegisters`: additional registers the box can carry over.\n\nThe `ErgoBoxCandidate` class has several methods:\n- `proposition`: transforms the `ergoTree` to a proposition, substituting the constants if the constant segregation flag is set.\n- `propositionBytes`: returns the serialized bytes of the guarding `ErgoTree`.\n- `bytesWithNoRef`: returns the serialized bytes of this box without transaction reference data (transaction ID and index).\n- `toBox(txId: ModifierId, boxIndex: Short)`: creates a new `ErgoBox` based on this candidate using the given transaction reference data.\n- `get(identifier: RegisterId)`: extracts register by ID.\n\nThe `ErgoBoxCandidate` class also has a `tokens` field, which is a map of additional tokens stored in the box, merged into a map. This method is not used in `ErgoTree` and serialization and is not part of consensus.\n\nThe `ErgoBoxCandidate` class is serialized using the `ErgoBoxCandidate.serializer` object, which is a `SigmaSerializer` that serializes the `ErgoBoxCandidate` object to bytes. The `serializer` object has two methods: `serialize` and `parse`. The `serialize` method serializes the `ErgoBoxCandidate` object to bytes, while the `parse` method deserializes the bytes to an `ErgoBoxCandidate` object.\n\nThe `ErgoBoxCandidate` class is an important part of the Ergo blockchain, as it represents the UTXOs that can be spent in transactions. It is used in the larger project to manage the state of the blockchain and to ensure that transactions are valid.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoBoxCandidate` class?\n- The `ErgoBoxCandidate` class contains the same fields as `org.ergoplatform.ErgoBox`, except for the transaction id and index, which will be calculated after full transaction formation.\n\n2. What is the `proposition` method used for?\n- The `proposition` method returns the guarding script of the `ErgoBoxCandidate` as a `SigmaPropValue`, which should be evaluated to true in order to open this box.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `tokens` method?\n- The `tokens` method returns a map of additional tokens stored in the box, merged into a Map.

It contains various properties such as `lastBlockUtxoRoot`, `headers`, `preHeader`, `dataBoxes`, `boxesToSpend`, `spendingTransaction`, `selfIndex`, `extension`, `validationSettings`, `costLimit`, `initCost`, and `activatedScriptVersion`. These properties are used to provide necessary information for the execution and validation of ErgoScript.\n\nThe `ErgoLikeContext` class also provides several methods to create a new context with updated fields, such as `withErgoTreeVersion`, `withCostLimit`, `withInitCost`, `withValidationSettings`, `withExtension`, and `withTransaction`. These methods are useful for updating the context during the script execution process.\n\nAdditionally, there are several case objects that represent ErgoScript operations related to the context, such as `MinerPubkey`, `Height`, `Inputs`, `Outputs`, `LastBlockUtxoRootHash`, `Self`, `Context`, and `Global`. These objects are used to evaluate specific context-related operations during the script execution.\n\nFor example, the `Height` case object evaluates to an `IntConstant` built from `Context.currentHeight`. It has a fixed cost for calling the `Context.HEIGHT` Scala method and an `opType` of `SFunc(SContext, SInt)`.\n\nOverall, the `ErgoLikeContext` class and related case objects play a crucial role in the execution and validation of ErgoScript, providing necessary information and operations for the script evaluation process.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `ErgoLikeContext` class?**\n\n   The `ErgoLikeContext` class represents a script evaluation context that is passed to a prover and a verifier to execute and validate the guarding proposition of input boxes of a transaction.\n\n2. **What are the main components of the `ErgoLikeContext` class?**\n\n   The main components of the `ErgoLikeContext` class include the last block UTXO root, headers, preHeader, dataBoxes, boxesToSpend, spendingTransaction, selfIndex, extension, validationSettings, costLimit, initCost, and activatedScriptVersion.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `withErgoTreeVersion()` method in the `ErgoLikeContext` class?**\n\n   The `withErgoTreeVersion()` method is used to create a new instance of the `ErgoLikeContext` class with an updated ErgoTree version.

The class extends the Interpreter class and overrides its substDeserialize method. The purpose of this method is to deserialize a register of the SELF box. \n\nThe SELF box is a special box in the Ergo blockchain that represents the current transaction being executed. It contains registers that can be used to store data. The ErgoLikeInterpreter class provides a way to deserialize the data stored in these registers.\n\nThe substDeserialize method takes three parameters: a context object of type CTX, a function that updates the context object, and a node of type SValue. The method first checks if the node is an instance of the DeserializeRegister class. If it is, the method attempts to deserialize the register specified by the DeserializeRegister object.\n\nThe method retrieves the SELF box from the context object and gets the value of the register specified by the DeserializeRegister object. If the value is an EvaluatedValue of type SByteArray, the method deserializes the value using the deserializeMeasured method and updates the context object with the new context. If the deserialized value has a different type than expected, an error is thrown. If the value is not an EvaluatedValue of type SByteArray, the method returns None.\n\nIf the node is not an instance of the DeserializeRegister class, the method calls the superclass's substDeserialize method.\n\nOverall, the ErgoLikeInterpreter class provides a way to deserialize registers of the SELF box in an Ergo transaction. This can be useful for verifying transactions and executing smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain. An example usage of this class might be in a smart contract that requires deserialization of data stored in the SELF box registers.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It defines the inputs, data inputs, and output candidates for a transaction, as well as an identifier for the transaction. The `UnsignedErgoLikeTransaction` class is an implementation of this trait for unsigned transactions, while the `ErgoLikeTransaction` class is an implementation for signed transactions.

The `bytesToSign` method takes an `ErgoLikeTransactionTemplate` and returns the bytes that should be signed by provers. \n\nOverall, this code provides the basic building blocks for creating and manipulating transactions in the Ergo network.

ErgoTree is a data structure that represents a script guarding a box in the blockchain. Each box in the blockchain has a guarding script, which is evaluated when the box is spent. The functions in this code provide pre-defined scripts that can be used in various scenarios.\n\nThe `FalseProp` and `TrueProp` functions create ErgoTree objects with `false` and `true` propositions, respectively. These propositions are used to create guarding scripts that are always false or true, respectively. These scripts can be used in various scenarios, such as creating dummy boxes that cannot be spent.\n\nThe `expectedMinerOutScriptBytesVal` function creates a byte array value of the serialized reward output script proposition with a public key being substituted with a given public key. This function is used to create a script that allows sending coins to a box that is protected by a proposition that proves a dlog of a miner's public key and height is at least `delta` blocks bigger than the current one.\n\nThe `rewardOutputScript` function creates a script that is required for the box that collects mining rewards. This script allows spending the box if the height is greater than the box creation height plus `delta` and the miner's public key is provided.\n\nThe `feeProposition` function creates a script that allows sending coins to a box that is protected by a proposition that proves a dlog of a miner's public key and height is at least `delta` blocks bigger than the current one. This script is used to pay transaction fees in the blockchain.\n\nThe `emissionBoxProp` function creates a contract that only allows collecting emission rewards by a box with a miner proposition. This function is used to control the level of emission and does not allow taking more coins than prescribed by emission rules.\n\nThe `foundationScript` function creates a script that controls the level of emission and does not allow taking more coins than prescribed by emission rules. This script is protected by a custom proposition in R4, which is assumed to be a simple 2-of-3 multisignature with public keys of foundation members in the beginning. When foundation members spend this box, they are free to put any new proposition to the R4 register, thus they may add or remove members, or change it to something more complicated like `tokenThresholdScript`.\n\nThe `boxCreationHeight` function returns the creation height of a box.

It takes a BoxId as a parameter, which is the identifier of the box that should be added to the context. The toString method returns a string representation of the DataInput object, and the equals and hashCode methods are overridden to compare DataInput objects based on their boxId.\n\nUnsignedInput is a class that represents an input of a formed but unsigned transaction. It takes two parameters: the boxId of the box to be spent and an optional ContextExtension object that contains user-defined variables to be put into the context. If no ContextExtension is provided, an empty one is used. The class has two constructors, one that takes both parameters and another that takes only the boxId. The equals and hashCode methods are overridden to compare UnsignedInput objects based on their boxId.\n\nThe Input class represents a fully signed transaction input. It takes two parameters: the boxId of the box to be spent and a ProverResult object that contains the proof of spending correctness. The class extends UnsignedInput and overrides the toString method to return a string representation of the Input object. The equals and hashCode methods are overridden to compare Input objects based on their boxId.\n\nThe object Input contains a nested object serializer that extends SigmaSerializer and provides methods to serialize and parse Input objects.

The constants are collected in a sequence and each constant has an ID, value, and description. The constant IDs are stable and never change. Some constant values may be defined in terms of other more fundamental values. \n\nThe `SizeConstant` case class is used to define each constant. It takes a type parameter `T` that must be a subtype of `Numeric`. The `value` field holds the constant's value, the `id` field holds the constant's ID, and the `description` field holds a description of the constant. \n\nThe `SigmaConstants` object contains all the constants defined in the code. Each constant is defined as an object that extends the `SizeConstant` case class. For example, `MaxBoxSize` is defined as an object that extends `SizeConstant[Int]` with a value of `4 * 1024`, an ID of `1`, and a description of \"Box size should not be greater than provided value\". \n\nThe `ConstTable` field is a sequence of all the constants defined in the `SigmaConstants` object. It is created by collecting all the constant objects into a sequence. The `require` statement at the end of the `ConstTable` definition ensures that there are no duplicate constant IDs in the sequence. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to provide a centralized location for all the constants used in the Sigma protocol's logic and checks. By defining the constants as objects that extend the `SizeConstant` case class, the code provides a consistent and easy-to-use interface for accessing the constants. For example, to access the `MaxBoxSize` constant, one can simply call `SigmaConstants.MaxBoxSize.value`. \n\nOverall, this code provides a useful abstraction for working with constants in the Sigma protocol and can help simplify the codebase by providing a centralized location for all the constants used in the project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `RuleStatus` trait is the base trait for all rule status information and defines a single abstract method `statusCode` which returns a `Byte`. The `RuleStatus` object provides four `Byte` constants representing different rule status codes. \n\nThe `EnabledRule` case object represents the default status of a rule that is registered in the table but has not yet been altered by soft-forks. It extends the `RuleStatus` trait and sets its `statusCode` to `EnabledRuleCode`.\n\nThe `DisabledRule` case object represents the status of a rule that is disabled in the current version and has not yet been altered by soft-forks. It extends the `RuleStatus` trait and sets its `statusCode` to `DisabledRuleCode`.\n\nThe `ReplacedRule` case class represents the status of a rule that has been replaced by a new rule via soft-fork extensions. It extends the `RuleStatus` trait and sets its `statusCode` to `ReplacedRuleCode`. It takes a `newRuleId` parameter which is the ID of the new rule that replaces the rule marked with this status.\n\nThe `ChangedRule` case class represents the status of a rule whose parameters have been changed via soft-fork extensions. It extends the `RuleStatus` trait and sets its `statusCode` to `ChangedRuleCode`. It takes a `newValue` parameter which is the new value of the block extension value with key == rule.id. It overrides the `hashCode`, `canEqual`, and `equals` methods to ensure proper comparison of `ChangedRule` instances.\n\nThese classes and traits are likely used in a larger project related to blockchain validation. They provide a way to track the status of rules and their changes over time, particularly in the context of soft-fork extensions. The `RuleStatus` trait and its subclasses can be used to define the status of different rules in the system, while the `statusCode` method can be used to retrieve the status code of a particular rule. The `ReplacedRule` and `ChangedRule` classes provide additional information about rules that have been replaced or changed via soft-fork extensions.

What is the difference between DisabledRule and ReplacedRule?\n- DisabledRule represents a rule that is disabled in the current version and can be disabled via block extensions and voting process, while ReplacedRule represents a rule that is replaced by a new rule via soft-fork extensions and requires the new rule to be enabled at the same time.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the ChangedRule class and its methods?\n- The ChangedRule class represents the status of a rule whose parameters are changed via soft-fork extensions and provides a new value of block extension value with key == rule.id.

The RuleStatusSerializer object extends the SigmaSerializer class, which is a generic serializer for Sigma types. The RuleStatus class is used to represent the status of a rule in the Ergo blockchain. The purpose of this serializer is to convert instances of the RuleStatus class to and from bytes, so that they can be transmitted over the network or stored in a database.\n\nThe RuleStatusSerializer object defines two methods: serialize and parse. The serialize method takes a RuleStatus object and a SigmaByteWriter object as input, and writes the serialized bytes to the SigmaByteWriter. The parse method takes a SigmaByteReader object as input, reads the serialized bytes from the SigmaByteReader, and returns a RuleStatus object.\n\nThe RuleStatusSerializer object also defines a measureWrittenBytes method, which takes a function that writes to a SigmaByteWriter as input, and returns the number of bytes that would be written by that function. This method is used to calculate the size of the dataBytes field in the serialized format of a RuleStatus object.\n\nThe RuleStatusSerializer object defines a constant FirstRuleId, which is used to calculate the offset of a new rule in the ReplacedRule case of the serialize method. The serialize method uses pattern matching to determine the type of the RuleStatus object, and writes the appropriate bytes to the SigmaByteWriter. The parse method reads the bytes from the SigmaByteReader, and uses pattern matching to determine the type of the RuleStatus object.\n\nThe RuleStatusSerializer object also defines a comment that describes the format of the serialized bytes for a RuleStatus object. The serialized bytes consist of three fields: dataSize, statusCode, and dataBytes. The dataSize field is a UShort that specifies the number of bytes in the dataBytes field. The statusCode field is a Byte that specifies the type of the RuleStatus object. The dataBytes field is a variable-length field that contains the serialized bytes of the data associated with the RuleStatus object.\n\nOverall, the RuleStatusSerializer object is an important component of the Ergo blockchain, as it enables RuleStatus objects to be transmitted over the network and stored in a database. The serializer is used by other components of the Ergo blockchain to convert RuleStatus objects to and from bytes.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `RuleStatusSerializer` object?\n- The `RuleStatusSerializer` object is used to serialize and deserialize `RuleStatus` objects.\n\n2. What is the format for `RuleStatuses`?\n- The format for `RuleStatuses` includes a `dataSize` field (1-2 bytes), a `statusCode` field (1 byte), and a `dataBytes` field (dataSize bytes) that contains the serialized byte if status value.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `FirstRuleId` constant?\n- The `FirstRuleId` constant is used to calculate the offset of a new rule ID in the `ReplacedRule` case of the `serialize` method.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/validation/RuleStatusSerializer.md"}}],["230",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/validation/SigmaValidationSettings.scala)\n\nThe code in this file defines the configuration of validation rules for the Ergo blockchain platform. The purpose of this code is to provide a type-safe way to define and register validation rules that can be used to validate transactions and blocks on the blockchain. \n\nThe `ValidationRule` instances are implemented as objects and registered in `ValidationRules.currentSettings` to be used in the code to perform validation. The `currentSettings` value represents the validation settings of the current version of the code. The set of rules in `currentSettings` is fixed in the current version of the code, and only rule status can be changed. \n\nOlder versions of the code don't have access to the rules added in newer versions. The implementation of a specific rule, once released under a specific `ruleId`, should never be changed, hence `ruleId` denotes that implementation. However, the behavior of rules (released with code) can be altered by changing their status in block extensions section via voting. \n\nThe status changes are represented in `ValidationSettings` using the `RuleStatus` type. Each descendant class represents a particular change in the rule status. Rule ids are used as keys of the status values stored in the block extension section. `RuleStatus` instances are deserialized from the block extension values. Deserialized `(ruleId, status)` pairs are joined with the `(ruleId, status)` pairs in `currentSettings`, and for matching `ruleIds`, the default statuses stored in `currentSettings` are replaced with the new statuses obtained from the blockchain. Deserialized `(ruleId, status)` pairs which don't match with `currentSettings` are ignored. \n\nEach rule has an associated check of soft-fork condition by implementing the `isSoftFork` method. If `isSoftFork` returns true, then `ValidationException` raised by the rule is interpreted as a soft-fork condition. Depending on the use case, soft-fork condition allows some operations performed by an old code to succeed which otherwise would fail due to `ValidationException` raised by the validation rule. \n\nThe `SigmaValidationSettings` class is an abstract class that defines the interface for accessing and updating the validation rules and their statuses. The `MapSigmaValidationSettings` class is a concrete implementation of `SigmaValidationSettings` that uses a `Map` to store the validation rules and their statuses. \n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and extensible way to define and manage validation rules for the Ergo blockchain platform. Developers can define new rules as objects and register them in `ValidationRules.currentSettings` to be used in the code to perform validation. The `RuleStatus` type allows for dynamic changes to the behavior of rules via voting, while the `isSoftFork` method provides a way to handle soft-fork conditions for backward compatibility.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `ValidationRule` class and how is it used in this code?\n   \n   The `ValidationRule` class is used to implement each validation rule as an `object` and register it in `ValidationRules.currentSettings` to be used in the code to perform validation. It is also used to associate a check of soft-fork condition by implementing the `isSoftFork` method.\n\n2. How are rule statuses represented and updated in this code?\n   \n   Rule statuses are represented using the `RuleStatus` type and are stored in the block extension section using rule ids as keys. Deserialized (ruleId, status) pairs are joined with the (ruleId,status) pairs in `currentSettings`, and for matching ruleIds the default statuses stored in `currentSettings` are replaced with the new statuses obtained from the blockchain.

If `isSoftFork` returns true, then the exception is interpreted as a soft-fork condition, which allows some operations performed by an old code to succeed which otherwise would fail due to the exception raised by the validation rule. It is used in the `SigmaValidationSettings` class to determine if a `ValidationException` is a soft-fork condition.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/validation/SigmaValidationSettings.md"}}],["231",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/validation/SigmaValidationSettingsSerializer.scala)\n\nThe `SigmaValidationSettingsSerializer` object is responsible for serializing and deserializing instances of the `SigmaValidationSettings` class. This class represents the validation rules that are used to validate transactions in the Ergo blockchain. The rules are stored as a map of rule IDs to a tuple of a boolean indicating whether the rule is enabled and a `RuleStatus` object that contains additional information about the rule.\n\nThe `serialize` method takes a `SigmaValidationSettings` object and a `SigmaByteWriter` and writes the rules to the writer in a serialized format. The rules are first sorted by their ID and then written to the writer. Each rule is written as a pair of the rule ID (as a `UShort`) and the `RuleStatus` object (serialized using the `RuleStatusSerializer`). The number of rules is written as a `UInt` before the rules themselves.\n\nThe `parse` method takes a `SigmaByteReader` and reads the serialized rules from it. The number of rules is read as a `UInt` and then the rules themselves are read in a loop. Each rule is read as a pair of the rule ID (as a `UShort`) and the `RuleStatus` object (parsed using the `RuleStatusSerializer`). The resulting pairs are then filtered to remove any rules that are not present in the current validation settings (i.e., any rules that have been removed since the settings were serialized). Finally, the remaining pairs are used to update a copy of the current validation settings, which is then returned.\n\nOverall, this object provides a way to serialize and deserialize the validation rules used in the Ergo blockchain. This is important for storing the rules in a database or transmitting them over the network. The serialization format is designed to preserve roundtrip identity, meaning that serializing and then deserializing a set of rules should result in an identical set of rules. However, it may not preserve identity in the other direction (i.e., deserializing and then serializing a set of rules may not result in an identical set of rules).\n## Questions: \n 1.

A soft-fork is a change in the protocol that is backward-compatible, meaning that nodes that have not upgraded to the new version can still validate transactions and blocks created by nodes that have upgraded. \n\nThe `SoftForkChecker` trait defines an interface that must be implemented by objects that can check for soft-fork conditions. It has one method, `isSoftFork`, which takes four parameters: `vs`, `ruleId`, `status`, and `args`. `vs` is an object of type `SigmaValidationSettings` that contains validation settings actualized from blockchain extension sections. `ruleId` is an identifier for the validation rule that raised a `ValidationException`. `status` is the status of the rule in the blockchain, which is agreed upon via voting. `args` are the arguments of the validation rule with which the rule has raised the exception. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether `args` and `status` can be interpreted as a valid soft-fork condition. \n\nThe `SoftForkWhenReplaced` trait extends `SoftForkChecker` and checks for a specific type of soft-fork condition. It checks that the failed validation rule has a `ReplacedRule` status in the block extensions section. This means that the rule given by `ruleId` is not used in newer versions of the protocol and has been replaced by a new rule given by the `ReplacedRule` status. \n\nThe `SoftForkWhenCodeAdded` trait also extends `SoftForkChecker` and checks for another type of soft-fork condition. It checks that an unknown `code` is present in the `ChangedRule` new value stored in the block extensions section. This is interpreted as a soft-fork condition, meaning that the unknown `code` is not arbitrary but explicitly added to the blockchain configuration and implemented in newer versions of the protocol. \n\nOverall, these traits are used to check for soft-fork conditions in the Ergo blockchain protocol. They can be used by other parts of the project to ensure that nodes can still validate transactions and blocks even if they have not upgraded to the latest version of the protocol. Here is an example of how the `SoftForkWhenReplaced` trait can be used:\n\n```\nval checker: SoftForkChecker = new SoftForkWhenReplaced()\nval isSoftFork = checker.isSoftFork(vs, ruleId, status, args)\nif (isSoftFork) {\n  // handle soft-fork condition\n} else {\n  // continue with normal validation\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the SoftForkChecker trait?\n   - The SoftForkChecker trait is an interface implemented by objects capable of checking soft-fork conditions.\n\n2. What is the difference between SoftForkWhenReplaced and SoftForkWhenCodeAdded traits?\n   - SoftForkWhenReplaced checks if the failed validation rule has ReplacedRule status in block extensions section, while SoftForkWhenCodeAdded checks if the unknown `code` is present in the ChangedRule new value stored in block extensions section.\n\n3. What is the input and output of the isSoftFork method?\n   - The input of the isSoftFork method includes ValidationSettings, ruleId, status, and args.

These rules are used to check the correctness of ErgoScript code during deserialization and execution. The rules can be updated via soft-forks, allowing the blockchain to evolve without breaking consensus.\n\nThe `ValidationRule` class is the base class for all validation rules. Each rule has an `id` and a `description`. The actual validation logic is implemented in the `apply` methods of derived classes. The `checkRule` method ensures that the rule is registered and enabled, and is executed only once for each rule.\n\nThe `ValidationException` class is used to communicate soft-fork information when a validation rule fails. It contains the failed rule, the arguments that caused the failure, and an optional cause (another exception).\n\nThe `ValidationRules` object contains a collection of predefined validation rules, such as `CheckDeserializedScriptType`, `CheckDeserializedScriptIsSigmaProp`, `CheckValidOpCode`, and others. These rules are used to check various aspects of ErgoScript code, such as type correctness, opcode validity, and method availability.\n\nThe `trySoftForkable` method is used to execute a block of code that may throw a `ValidationException`. If a soft-fork condition is detected, the `whenSoftFork` block is executed, otherwise, the exception is rethrown.\n\nIn the larger project, these validation rules are used during ErgoScript deserialization and execution to ensure the correctness and safety of the code. For example, when deserializing an ErgoScript, the `CheckDeserializedScriptType` rule can be used to ensure that the deserialized script has the expected type:\n\n```scala\nValidationRules.CheckDeserializedScriptType(d, script)\n```\n\nThis helps maintain the integrity of the Ergo Platform blockchain by enforcing a set of rules that all ErgoScript code must adhere to.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ValidationRule` class and how is it used in the code?\n   **Answer**: The `ValidationRule` class is a base class for different validation rules registered in `ValidationRules.currentSettings`.

It is used to check soft-forkable conditions and throw `ValidationException` when a rule is violated.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `trySoftForkable` function work and when should it be used?\n   **Answer**: The `trySoftForkable` function is used to execute a block of code that may throw a `ValidationException`. It takes a `whenSoftFork` parameter, which is executed when a soft-fork condition is detected. If the soft-fork condition is not recognized by the given `SigmaValidationSettings`, the `ValidationException` is thrown. This function should be used when checking for possible soft-fork conditions in the context of the given `SigmaValidationSettings`.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `CheckPositionLimit` validation rule and how does it work?\n   **Answer**: The `CheckPositionLimit` validation rule is used to check that the reader has not exceeded the position limit during deserialization. It throws a `ValidationException` with the given parameters if the position is greater than the position limit. This rule can be replaced with a new rule and the limit can be increased, allowing for soft-fork conditions to be checked.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/validation/ValidationRules.md"}}],["234",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/.autodoc/docs/json/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/validation)\n\nThe code in this folder is related to the validation of the Ergo blockchain platform.

The AvlTreeFlags case class is used to represent the allowed operations on an AVL+ tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree. The insertAllowed, updateAllowed, and removeAllowed fields are Boolean values that indicate whether the corresponding operation is allowed on the tree. The AvlTreeFlags object provides four predefined instances of AvlTreeFlags, namely ReadOnly, AllOperationsAllowed, InsertOnly, and RemoveOnly. These instances are used to set the allowed operations on an AVL+ tree.\n\nThe AvlTreeData case class is used to represent the data of an AVL+ tree. It contains the authenticated tree digest, treeFlags, keyLength, and valueLengthOpt fields. The authenticated tree digest is the root hash of the tree along with its height. The treeFlags field is an instance of AvlTreeFlags that specifies the allowed operations on the tree. The keyLength field is an integer that represents the length of the keys in the tree. The valueLengthOpt field is an optional integer that represents the length of the values in the tree.\n\nThe AvlTreeFlags object provides two methods, apply and serializeFlags. The apply method is used to create an instance of AvlTreeFlags from a serialized byte. The serializeFlags method is used to serialize an instance of AvlTreeFlags to a byte. The AvlTreeData object provides a serializer object that implements the SigmaSerializer trait. The serializer object is used to serialize and deserialize an instance of AvlTreeData to and from bytes.\n\nThe AvlTreeData object also provides a method, avlTreeFromDigest, that creates an instance of AvlTreeData from a given digest. The method sets the allowed operations on the tree to insertAllowed, updateAllowed, and removeAllowed. The AvlTreeData object also provides two constants, DigestSize and TreeDataSize, that represent the size of the digest and the size of the tree data, respectively. The dummy field is an instance of AvlTreeData that is used as a placeholder.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the AvlTreeData class?\n- The AvlTreeData class is used to efficiently authenticate a potentially huge dataset with a key-value dictionary interface by storing only the root hash of a dynamic AVL+ tree, tree height, key length, optional value length, and access flags.\n\n2. What are the different flags available in the AvlTreeFlags object?\n- The AvlTreeFlags object has four different flags: ReadOnly, AllOperationsAllowed, InsertOnly, and RemoveOnly. These flags determine which modifications are allowed on the AVL tree.\n\n3. How is the AvlTreeData class serialized and deserialized?\n- The AvlTreeData class is serialized using the SigmaSerializer interface, which writes the authenticated tree digest, tree flags, key length, and optional value length to a byte stream.

The `CostKind` trait is an abstract class that is extended by other classes to describe different types of costs. The `FixedCost` class describes a simple fixed cost that is associated with a single operation. The `PerItemCost` class describes the cost of an operation over a collection of known length. It takes into account the cost of the operation factored out of the loop iterations, the cost associated with each chunk of items, and the number of items in a chunk. The `TypeBasedCost` trait is an abstract class that describes the cost of an operation that depends on the type of the input. Finally, the `DynamicCost` object describes the cost of an operation that cannot be described using a fixed set of parameters.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to estimate the cost of executing operations in the SigmaState project. This information can be used to optimize the execution of the project by identifying operations that are particularly expensive and finding ways to reduce their cost. For example, if an operation has a high fixed cost, it may be beneficial to avoid using that operation in situations where it is not strictly necessary.\n\nHere is an example of how the `PerItemCost` class can be used to compute the cost of an operation:\n\n```\nval baseCost = JitCost(10)\nval perChunkCost = JitCost(5)\nval chunkSize = 100\nval cost = PerItemCost(baseCost, perChunkCost, chunkSize)\nval nItems = 500\nval totalCost = cost.cost(nItems)\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `PerItemCost` object with a base cost of 10, a per-chunk cost of 5, and a chunk size of 100. We then compute the cost of an operation that processes 500 items. The `cost` method of the `PerItemCost` object computes the total cost of the operation based on the number of items and the chunk size. The `totalCost` variable contains the computed cost.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `CostKind` class and its subclasses?\n- The `CostKind` class and its subclasses are used to describe the cost of different operations in the `sigmastate` package.\n\n2. What is the difference between `FixedCost` and `PerItemCost`?\n- `FixedCost` describes the cost of a single operation with a fixed cost, while `PerItemCost` describes the cost of an operation over a collection of known length, factoring in the cost of each chunk of items.\n\n3. Why is there an override of `hashCode()` in the `PerItemCost` class?\n- The override of `hashCode()` in the `PerItemCost` class is necessary to avoid JitCost instances allocation in the default generated code for case class.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/CostKind.md"}}],["238",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/DataValueComparer.scala)\n\nThe `DataValueComparer` object in the given code provides an implementation for comparing two arbitrary ErgoTree data types for equality. It focuses on the high-level purpose of the code and how it may be used in the larger project. The comparison is performed recursively, descending on the value structure regardless of the depth. However, every step costs are accrued to `E.coster`, and the defined limit `E.coster.costLimit` is checked. Thus, the execution of this method is limited and always finishes at least as fast as the costLimit prescribes.\n\nThe `equalDataValues` method is the main function for comparing two data values. It dispatches on the type of the left value and then performs the specific comparison. The method handles various data types, such as numbers, booleans, collections, tuples, group elements, big integers, sigma properties, AVL trees, options, pre-headers, headers, and boxes.\n\nFor example, when comparing two collections, the `equalColls_Dispatch` method is called, which dispatches to the most efficient implementation depending on the actual type `A`. Similarly, when comparing two SigmaBoolean trees, the `equalSigmaBoolean` method is called.\n\nThe code also defines various cost constants for different types of comparisons, which are part of the consensus protocol and cannot be changed without forking. These constants are used to calculate the cost of each comparison operation, ensuring that the comparison process is efficient and adheres to the protocol's cost limits.\n\nOverall, the `DataValueComparer` object provides a comprehensive and efficient way to compare ErgoTree data types, which is essential for various operations in the larger project.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `DataValueComparer` object and its methods?\n   **Answer**: The `DataValueComparer` object provides an implementation for comparing two arbitrary ErgoTree data types for equality. It contains various methods for comparing different data types, such as collections, tuples, group elements, big integers, etc., and takes into account the cost of each comparison operation.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the cost of comparison operations affect the execution of the code?\n   **Answer**: The cost of comparison operations is used to limit the execution time and resources consumed by the code. The ErgoTreeEvaluator keeps track of the accrued costs during the execution, and if the cost limit is reached, the execution is stopped. This ensures that the code execution is always within the defined limits and prevents potential denial-of-service attacks.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `equalDataValues` method handle different data types and their comparisons?\n   **Answer**: The `equalDataValues` method uses pattern matching to dispatch the comparison based on the type of the left value.

ErgoTree is a language used to define spending conditions in the Ergo blockchain platform. This object is responsible for registering various classes, constructors, and methods related to ErgoTree script evaluation.\n\nThe code registers classes like `AND`, `ArithOp`, `AtLeast`, `BinAnd`, `BinOr`, `BinXor`, `BoolToSigmaProp`, `ByteArrayToBigInt`, and many others. These classes represent various operations and data structures used in ErgoTree scripts. For each class, the code registers one or more constructors using the `mkConstructor` method. These constructors are responsible for creating instances of the respective classes.\n\nAdditionally, the code registers methods for some classes like `SAvlTree`, `SCollection`, and `SGlobal`. These methods are used to perform various operations on instances of the respective classes.

The `size` method returns the number of nodes in the corresponding Sigma tree, which is four in this case. The `ProveDHTupleProp` object provides an extractor for matching SigmaProp values and extracting `ProveDHTuple` objects from them.\n\nOverall, this code provides the necessary functionality for implementing the DHT Sigma protocol in a larger project.

The discrete logarithm problem is a mathematical problem that involves finding a unique integer x given a generator g of a finite group G and a random element h in G such that g^x = h. In cryptography, groups for which the discrete logarithm problem is assumed to be hard are of interest. The most known groups of that kind are some Elliptic curve groups.\n\nThe DlogGroup trait has several methods that are used to perform operations on the group. The generator method returns the generator of the Dlog group, which is an element of the group such that, when written multiplicatively, every element of the group is a power of the generator. The order method returns the order of the Dlog group, and the identity method returns the identity element of the Dlog group.\n\nThe trait also has methods for performing operations on group elements. The inverseOf method calculates the inverse of a given group element, and the exponentiate method raises a base group element to the exponent. The multiplyGroupElements method multiplies two group elements.\n\nThe trait also has methods for creating random elements and generators of the Dlog group. The createRandomElement method creates a random member of the Dlog group, and the createRandomGenerator method creates a random generator of the Dlog group.\n\nThe exponentiateWithPreComputedValues method computes the product of several exponentiations of the same base and distinct exponents. An optimization is used to compute it more quickly by keeping in memory the result of h1, h2, h4,h8,... and using it in the calculation. The endExponentiateWithPreComputedValues method cleans up any resources used by exponentiateWithPreComputedValues for the requested base.\n\nFinally, the maxLengthOfByteArrayForEncoding method returns the maximum length of a string to be encoded to a Group Element of this group. Any string of length k has a numeric value that is less than (p-1)/2 - 1. k is the maximum length a binary string is allowed to be in order to encode the said binary string to a group element and vice-versa. If a string exceeds the k length, it cannot be encoded.\n\nOverall, the DlogGroup trait provides a set of methods for performing operations on a discrete logarithm prime-order group, which is useful in cryptography and other applications that involve mathematical groups.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is used throughout the interface to specify the type of input and output for various methods.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `createRandomGenerator` method?\n- The `createRandomGenerator` method generates a random generator of the Dlog group. In prime order groups, every element except the identity is a generator, so this method generates a random element and checks if it is the identity. If it is, it generates a new random element until a non-identity element is found.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/basics/DlogGroup.md"}}],["251",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/basics/SigmaProtocolFunctions.scala)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the SigmaState project and contains a set of traits and classes that abstract Sigma protocols.

This method is used internally by the other methods in the object to generate random `BigInteger` values.\n\nThe `createRandomBigInteger` method generates a random `BigInteger` with the specified bit length using the `createRandom` method. The resulting `BigInteger` is guaranteed to be positive.\n\nThe `createRandomInRange` method generates a random `BigInteger` between the specified `min` and `max` values (inclusive) using the `createRandomBigInteger` method. If `min` is greater than `max`, the method throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. If `min` has a bit length greater than half of `max`'s bit length, the method recursively calls itself with `min` set to 0 and `max` set to `max - min`, and then adds `min` to the resulting `BigInteger`. This is done to avoid bias in the random number generation when the range is small compared to the maximum possible value of a `BigInteger`.

If the limit is reached without finding a suitable value, a fallback method is used.\n\n3. Why is the asUnsignedByteArray method necessary?\n- The asUnsignedByteArray method is necessary because the toByteArray method of BigInteger includes a leading sign bit, which may cause issues when working with cryptographic protocols that require unsigned byte arrays.

If points are not all distinct, or if 0 is in the points array and valueAt0!=null, behavior is undefined. valueAt0 is separated only for efficiency reason; the caller can treat 0 like any other point instead (i.e., the points array can include 0 if valueAt0==null, but computation will be slightly less efficient). If points is null, or values is null, or if lengths of points and values arrays differ, or if the arrays are 0 length and valueAt0 is null, returns null.

What other exceptions does the `sigmastate.exceptions` package contain?\n\n   Without further information, it is impossible to determine what other exceptions the `sigmastate.exceptions` package contains. However, it is likely that it contains other custom exception classes that are used to handle specific types of errors in the `sigmastate` library.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/exceptions/InvalidArguments.md"}}],["270",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/exceptions/SigmaExceptions.scala)\n\nThe code above defines several exception classes that are used in the larger project. These exceptions are used to handle errors that may occur during the execution of the project. \n\nThe `SigmaException` class is the base class for all the exceptions defined in this file. It takes in a message and an optional cause, which is a Throwable object that caused the exception. This class extends the built-in `Exception` class in Scala.\n\nThe `SerializerException` class is a subclass of `SigmaException` and is used to handle errors that occur during serialization. It takes in a message and an optional cause, just like `SigmaException`.\n\nThe `InterpreterException` class is another subclass of `SigmaException` and is used to handle errors that occur during interpretation. It takes in a message and an optional cause, just like `SigmaException`.\n\nThe `CostLimitException` class is also a subclass of `SigmaException` and is used to handle errors that occur when the estimated cost of executing a program exceeds a certain limit. It takes in an estimated cost, a message, and an optional cause. The estimated cost is a long value that represents the estimated cost of executing a program, while the message is a string that describes the error. \n\nThe `CostLimitException` class also defines a companion object that contains a single method called `msgCostLimitError`. This method takes in two `JitCost` objects, `cost` and `limit`, and returns a string that describes the error. This method is used to generate error messages when a `CostLimitException` is thrown.\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of exception classes that can be used to handle errors that may occur during the execution of the larger project. These exceptions can be thrown when an error occurs, and the appropriate error message can be generated using the methods provided by these classes. For example, if the estimated cost of executing a program exceeds a certain limit, a `CostLimitException` can be thrown with an appropriate error message generated using the `msgCostLimitError` method.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `SigmaException` class and its subclasses?\n- The `SigmaException` class and its subclasses (`SerializerException`, `InterpreterException`, and `CostLimitException`) are used to represent different types of exceptions that can occur in the `sigmastate` package.\n\n2.

These exceptions are used to handle specific error scenarios that may occur during serialization and deserialization of data. \n\nThe first exception, `InvalidTypePrefix`, is thrown by the `TypeSerializer` class when the type prefix is less than or equal to zero. This exception is used to handle cases where the type prefix is invalid, which can occur when the serialized data is corrupted or malformed. \n\nThe second exception, `ReaderPositionLimitExceeded`, is thrown when the current reader position is greater than the position limit set in the `Reader` class. This exception is used to handle cases where the serialized data is too large or exceeds the specified limit. \n\nThe third exception, `DeserializeCallDepthExceeded`, is thrown when the current depth level is greater than the maximum depth level set in the `Reader` class. This exception is used to handle cases where the serialized data contains too many nested structures, which can cause a stack overflow or other memory-related issues. \n\nThe fourth exception, `InvalidOpCode`, is thrown by the `ValidationRules.CheckValidOpCode` validation rule. This exception is used to handle cases where the serialized data contains an invalid opcode, which can occur when the data is corrupted or malformed. \n\nOverall, these custom exceptions are an important part of the larger project as they provide a way to handle specific error scenarios that may occur during serialization and deserialization of data. By using these exceptions, the project can ensure that errors are handled in a consistent and predictable manner, which can help to improve the overall reliability and stability of the system. \n\nExample usage of these exceptions in the project may look like this:\n\n```\ntry {\n  // code that performs serialization or deserialization\n} catch {\n  case e: InvalidTypePrefix => // handle invalid type prefix error\n  case e: ReaderPositionLimitExceeded => // handle reader position limit exceeded error\n  case e: DeserializeCallDepthExceeded => // handle deserialize call depth exceeded error\n  case e: InvalidOpCode => // handle invalid opcode error\n  case _ => // handle other errors\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What are the different types of exceptions defined in this file and when are they thrown?\n   - The different types of exceptions defined in this file are `InvalidTypePrefix`, `ReaderPositionLimitExceeded`, `DeserializeCallDepthExceeded`, and `InvalidOpCode`. They are thrown when the type prefix is less than or equal to 0, the current reader position exceeds the position limit, the current depth level exceeds the maximum depth level, and the opcode is invalid respectively.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `cause` parameter in the exception classes?\n   - The `cause` parameter is an optional parameter that can be used to specify the underlying cause of the exception.

These exceptions are used to handle errors related to invalid binary and unary operation parameters, method not found, and non-applicable method. \n\nThe `InvalidBinaryOperationParameters` and `InvalidUnaryOperationParameters` classes are used to handle errors that occur when the parameters passed to a binary or unary operation are invalid. These exceptions are thrown when the type of the parameters is not compatible with the operation being performed. For example, if the code tries to perform a binary operation on two values of different types, an `InvalidBinaryOperationParameters` exception will be thrown.\n\nThe `MethodNotFound` class is used to handle errors that occur when a method is not found. This exception is thrown when the code tries to call a method that does not exist. For example, if the code tries to call a method that has been misspelled or does not exist in the current context, a `MethodNotFound` exception will be thrown.\n\nThe `NonApplicableMethod` class is used to handle errors that occur when a method is not applicable. This exception is thrown when the code tries to call a method with parameters that are not compatible with the method's signature. For example, if the code tries to call a method that expects an integer parameter with a string parameter, a `NonApplicableMethod` exception will be thrown.\n\nOverall, these custom exception classes are an important part of the larger project as they help to handle errors that occur during the execution of the code. By defining these custom exceptions, the code can provide more detailed error messages to the user, making it easier to identify and fix issues. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\ntry {\n  // perform a binary operation with invalid parameters\n  val result = 5 + \"hello\"\n} catch {\n  case e: InvalidBinaryOperationParameters => println(e.getMessage)\n}\n\ntry {\n  // call a non-existent method\n  val result = someObject.nonExistentMethod()\n} catch {\n  case e: MethodNotFound => println(e.getMessage)\n}\n\ntry {\n  // call a method with non-applicable parameters\n  val result = someObject.someMethod(\"hello\")\n} catch {\n  case e: NonApplicableMethod => println(e.getMessage)\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `sigmastate.exceptions` package?\n- The `sigmastate.exceptions` package contains classes that define custom exceptions related to type checking in the Sigma programming language.\n\n2.

These exception classes provide detailed error messages to help users identify and fix errors in their code.\n\nFor example, the `CompilerExceptions.scala` file contains the base `CompilerException` class and its subclasses, which represent specific types of errors that can occur during the compilation process. These subclasses include `BinderException`, `TyperException`, `BuilderException`, and `CosterException`. They can be used in a try-catch block to catch and handle errors during different phases of the compilation process:\n\n```scala\ntry {\n  // code that compiles Sigma smart contract\n} catch {\n  case e: BinderException => println(\"Error during binding phase: \" + e.getMessage)\n  case e: TyperException => println(\"Error during type checking phase: \" + e.getMessage)\n  case e: BuilderException => println(\"Error during construction phase: \" + e.getMessage)\n  case e: CosterException => println(\"Error during cost estimation phase: \" + e.getMessage)\n  case e: CompilerException => println(\"Error during compilation: \" + e.getMessage)\n}\n```\n\nOther exception classes in this folder, such as `ConstraintFailed`, `InvalidArguments`, and the exceptions in `SigmaExceptions.scala`, handle specific error scenarios related to the Sigma state language, invalid arguments, and execution errors. These exceptions can be used in the larger project to handle errors in a consistent and predictable manner, improving the overall reliability and stability of the system.\n\nFor instance, the `InvalidArguments` exception can be used to handle cases where a function receives an invalid argument:\n\n```scala\ndef divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {\n  if (b == 0) {\n    throw new InvalidArguments(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n  }\n  a / b\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, the exception classes in this folder play a crucial role in the error handling mechanism of the larger project. They help developers handle errors related to the Sigma programming language, invalid arguments, and execution issues in a consistent and predictable way, ultimately improving the overall reliability and stability of the system.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/exceptions/summary.md"}}],["274",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/interpreter/CostAccumulator.scala)\n\nThe code defines two classes, `CostCounter` and `CostAccumulator`, which are used to track the cost of executing a program. \n\n`CostCounter` is a simple class that encapsulates a monotonic counter that can only be incremented. It has an initial cost value, which is set when the counter is created, and a current cost value, which is updated each time the counter is incremented. The `resetCost()` method can be used to reset the current cost value to the initial value.\n\n`CostAccumulator` is a more complex class that implements a finite state machine with a stack of graph blocks (scopes), which correspond to lambdas and thunks. It accepts messages: `startScope()`, `endScope()`, `add()`, and `reset()`. At any time, `totalCost` is the currently accumulated cost.\n\nThe `Scope` class represents a single scope during execution of the graph. When the evaluation enters a new scope (e.g. calling a lambda), a new `Scope` instance is created and pushed to the `_scopeStack`, then it starts receiving `add` method calls. When the evaluation leaves the scope, the top is popped off the stack. The `add` method is called once for each operation of a scope (lambda or thunk), and it updates the current cost of the current scope. If the current accumulated cost exceeds the `costLimit`, a `CostLimitException` is thrown.\n\nThe `reset()` method resets the accumulator into its initial state to be ready for new graph execution. The `totalCost` method returns the total accumulated cost.\n\nOverall, these classes are used to track the cost of executing a program and ensure that it does not exceed a certain limit. They can be used in the larger project to optimize the execution of the program and prevent it from consuming too many resources. For example, the `CostAccumulator` class could be used to optimize the execution of smart contracts on a blockchain by limiting their resource consumption.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `CostAccumulator` class?\n- The `CostAccumulator` class implements a finite state machine with a stack of graph blocks (scopes) and is used to accumulate costs for each operation of a scope.

It provides two concrete implementations of the abstract class `CostDetails`: `TracedCost` and `GivenCost`. The former is used to represent detailed results of cost evaluation, while the latter is used to represent the cost of Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) costing. \n\nThe `CostDetails` class has three methods: `cost`, `trace`, and `actualTimeNano`. The `cost` method returns the total cost of evaluation, which is a `JitCost` object. The `trace` method returns the trace of costed operations performed during evaluation, which is a sequence of `CostItem` objects. The `actualTimeNano` method returns the actual execution time (in nanoseconds) if defined. \n\nThe `TracedCost` class extends `CostDetails` and has two fields: `trace` and `actualTimeNano`. The `trace` field is the accumulated trace of all cost items obtained during execution of `ErgoTree` operations. The `actualTimeNano` field is the measured time of execution (if some). The `cost` method of `TracedCost` calculates the total cost of all cost items by iterating over the `trace` sequence and summing up the costs of each `CostItem`. \n\nThe `GivenCost` class also extends `CostDetails` and has one field: `cost`. The `cost` field is the given value of the total cost obtained from AOT costing. The `actualTimeNano` field is the measured time of execution (if some). The `trace` method of `GivenCost` returns an empty sequence of `CostItem` objects since there is no trace available for AOT costing. \n\nThe `CostDetails` object provides three methods: `EmptyTrace`, `ZeroCost`, and `apply`. The `EmptyTrace` method returns an empty sequence of `CostItem` objects and should be used whenever possible to avoid allocations. The `ZeroCost` method returns a `TracedCost` object with an empty trace and zero total cost. The `apply` method is a helper factory method to create `CostDetails` objects from the given trace. \n\nThe `unapply` method of `CostDetails` is a helper recognizer to work with different representations of costs in patterns uniformly. It takes a `CostDetails` object as input and returns an `Option` of a tuple containing the total cost and the trace of cost items. It matches the input object against `TracedCost` and `GivenCost` and returns the appropriate tuple based on the type of the input object. \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to represent and manipulate cost results obtained during evaluation in a flexible and extensible manner. It can be used in the larger project to optimize the performance of `ErgoTree` operations and reduce the computational cost of evaluating complex scripts. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval trace = Seq(CostItem(op1, cost1), CostItem(op2, cost2), CostItem(op3, cost3))\nval costDetails = CostDetails(trace)\nval totalCost = costDetails.cost\nval traceItems = costDetails.trace\nval actualTime = costDetails.actualTimeNano.getOrElse(0L)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the difference between `TracedCost` and `GivenCost`?\n- `TracedCost` represents the detailed results of cost evaluation obtained during execution of `ErgoTree` operations, while `GivenCost` represents the cost of AOT (ahead-of-time) costing using a given value.\n\n3.

The purpose of these cost items is to track the cost of evaluating an ErgoTree, which is important for determining transaction fees and preventing denial-of-service attacks.\n\nThe `CostItem` abstract class defines the basic structure of a cost item, with two properties: `opName`, which is a string representing the name of the operation being performed, and `cost`, which is a `JitCost` object representing the cost of the operation.\n\nThe `FixedCostItem` class represents the cost of a simple operation that has a fixed cost, such as adding two numbers together. It takes an `OperationDesc` object and a `FixedCost` object as parameters, which describe the operation being performed and the cost of that operation, respectively. The `opName` property is set to the name of the operation, and the `cost` property is set to the fixed cost.\n\nThe `TypeBasedCostItem` class represents the cost of an operation that depends on the type of the arguments being passed in, such as comparing two values of different types. It takes an `OperationDesc` object, a `TypeBasedCost` object, and an `SType` object as parameters, which describe the operation being performed, the cost of that operation based on the type of the arguments, and the concrete type on which the operation is being executed, respectively. The `opName` property is set to the name of the operation followed by the concrete type, and the `cost` property is set to the cost of the operation based on the concrete type.\n\nThe `SeqCostItem` class represents the cost of a sequence of operations, such as iterating over a collection of values. It takes an `OperationDesc` object, a `PerItemCost` object, and an integer representing the number of items in the sequence as parameters, which describe the operation being performed, the cost of that operation per item, and the number of items in the sequence, respectively. The `opName` property is set to the name of the operation, and the `cost` property is set to the cost of the operation multiplied by the number of items in the sequence.\n\nThe `MethodCallCostItem` class represents the cost of a method call operation, which is a special type of operation that calls a method on an object. It takes a `CostDetails` object as a parameter, which contains the cost details obtained as part of the method call evaluation. The `opName` property is set to the name of the method call operation, and the `cost` property is set to the cost of the method call.\n\nOverall, these classes and objects provide a way to track the cost of evaluating an ErgoTree, which is important for ensuring the security and stability of the Ergo blockchain. They can be used for debugging, testing, and profiling of costing, and can be integrated into larger projects that involve ErgoTree evaluation. For example, a transaction validation system might use these cost items to determine the transaction fee and prevent denial-of-service attacks.\n## Questions: \n 1.

ErgoTree is a declarative intermediate representation for Ergo contracts, designed to be compact in serialized form and directly executable. The interpreter works directly with ErgoTree's higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) and follows its denotational semantics.\n\nThe main method of the `ErgoTreeEvaluator` class is `eval`, which evaluates a given expression in a given data environment. The class also provides methods for evaluating expressions with cost, such as `evalWithCost`, which returns the value of the expression and the total accumulated cost in the coster.\n\nThe `EvalSettings` case class contains configuration parameters for the evaluation run, such as flags for measuring operation time, enabling debug mode, logging, cost tracing, and specifying evaluation mode. The `EvaluationMode` object defines two evaluation modes: `AotEvaluationMode` for executing using AOT costing implementation of v4.x protocol, and `JitEvaluationMode` for executing using JIT costing implementation of v5.x protocol.\n\nThe `ErgoTreeEvaluator` class also provides methods for adding costs to the coster, such as `addCost`, `addTypeBasedCost`, `addFixedCost`, and `addSeqCost`. These methods are used to accumulate costs during the evaluation of expressions, and can be associated with operation descriptors for tracing and profiling purposes.\n\nExample usage of the `ErgoTreeEvaluator` class would involve creating an instance with the desired context, constants, cost accumulator, profiler, and settings, and then using the `eval` method to evaluate an ErgoTree expression in a given data environment.\n\n```scala\nval context: ErgoLikeContext = ...\nval constants: Seq[Constant[SType]] = ...\nval costAccumulator = new CostAccumulator(...)\nval profiler = new Profiler\nval settings = EvalSettings(...)\n\nval evaluator = new ErgoTreeEvaluator(context, constants, costAccumulator, profiler, settings)\nval env: DataEnv = ...\nval exp: SValue = ...\n\nval result: Any = evaluator.eval(env, exp)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `ErgoTreeEvaluator` class?**\n\n   The `ErgoTreeEvaluator` class is an interpreter for ErgoTrees, which are a simple declarative intermediate representation for Ergo contracts.

The `RealSecretProof` and `SimulatedSecretProof` case classes extend the `SecretProven` class and define hints that contain a proof-of-knowledge for a secret associated with its public image, with the mark that the proof is real or simulated. \n\nThe `CommitmentHint` abstract class extends the `Hint` trait and defines a family of hints that are about a correspondence between a public image of a secret image and prover's commitment to randomness. The `OwnCommitment`, `RealCommitment`, and `SimulatedCommitment` case classes extend the `CommitmentHint` class and define hints that contain a commitment to randomness associated with a public image of a secret, with or without randomness itself.\n\nThe `HintsBag` case class defines a collection of hints to be used by a prover. It contains a sequence of hints and provides methods to add hints to the bag, concatenate bags, and extract specific types of hints from the bag. The `empty` object is a pre-defined empty `HintsBag`.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to facilitate the proving process of statements that involve secrets and commitments to randomness. The hints can be generated by the prover or obtained from other sources, and then added to the `HintsBag`. The bag can be passed to the proving function, which can use the hints to construct a proof. The hints can also be used to verify a proof by checking the correspondence between the public images and the commitments. \n\nFor example, a prover can use the `RealSecretProof` hint to prove that they know a secret associated with a public image, and the verifier can use the `RealCommitment` hint to verify that the commitment used in the proof corresponds to the public image. The `OwnCommitment` hint can be used to prove that the prover has a commitment to randomness that is used in the proof, and the verifier can use the `SimulatedCommitment` hint to simulate the commitment and check its validity.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is responsible for evaluating ErgoTree expressions in a given context and verifying them. The interpreter supports two alternative implementations: the old implementation from v4.x based on AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) costing, and the new implementation added in v5.0 based on JIT (Just-In-Time) costing. Both implementations are equivalent in v5.0 but have different performance, resulting in different cost estimations.\n\nThe interpreter provides methods for ErgoTree evaluation (reduction) to a sigma proposition (SigmaBoolean) in a given context, and for verification of ErgoTree in a given context. It also handles soft-fork conditions and deserialization of context variables.\n\nHere's an example of how the interpreter is used in the larger project:\n\n```scala\nval interpreter = new Interpreter()\nval ergoTree: ErgoTree = ...\nval context: CTX = ...\nval env: ScriptEnv = ...\nval reductionResult: ReductionResult = interpreter.fullReduction(ergoTree, context, env)\n```\n\nThe `fullReduction` method takes an ErgoTree, a context, and an environment, and returns a `ReductionResult` containing the reduced SigmaBoolean value and the estimated cost of the contract execution.\n\nThe `verify` method is used to execute a script in a given context and verify its result:\n\n```scala\nval proof: Array[Byte] = ...\nval message: Array[Byte] = ...\nval verificationResult: Try[VerificationResult] = interpreter.verify(env, ergoTree, context, proof, message)\n```\n\nThe `verify` method returns a `Try[VerificationResult]`, which contains a boolean indicating whether the script executed successfully and the estimated cost of the script execution.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `deserializeMeasured` method and why is it using `ValueSerializer` instead of `ErgoTreeSerializer`?\n   \n   **Answer**: The `deserializeMeasured` method is used to deserialize the given script bytes using `ValueSerializer` while also measuring the tree complexity and updating the context's initial cost. It uses `ValueSerializer` because, although ErgoTree is always of type SigmaProp, `ValueSerializer` can serialize expressions of any type, making it more versatile in this case.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `checkSoftForkCondition` method handle soft-fork conditions in the interpreter?\n\n   **Answer**: The `checkSoftForkCondition` method checks if the activated script version is higher than the maximum supported script version or if the ErgoTree version is higher than the activated script version. If a soft-fork condition is detected, it returns a `VerificationResult` with a true value and the initial cost. If no soft-fork condition is detected, it proceeds with the normal execution.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `estimateCryptoVerifyCost` method and how does it work?\n\n   **Answer**: The `estimateCryptoVerifyCost` method computes the estimated cost of verification of a given sigma proposition without actually performing expensive crypto operations. It does this by recursively computing the total cost of the given children in the proposition tree and summing up the costs for each type of node (e.g., ProveDlog, ProveDHTuple, CAND, COR, CTHRESHOLD).","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/interpreter/Interpreter.md"}}],["280",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/interpreter/InterpreterContext.scala)\n\nThe code defines the ContextExtension and InterpreterContext classes, which are used to manage user-defined variables and context data in the ErgoScript interpreter. \n\nThe ContextExtension class represents a container for key-value pairs, where each key is identified by a Byte and can be accessed from a script using the getVar[T](id) operation. The value of the variable is represented by a Constant instance, which contains both data value and SType descriptor. The descriptor is checked against the type T expected in the script operation. If the types don't match, an exception is thrown and the box spending (protected by the script) fails. The class provides an add method to add new bindings to the internal container.\n\nThe InterpreterContext trait is a base class for the context passed to verifier and prover. It defines several properties, including extension, validationSettings, costLimit, initCost, and activatedScriptVersion. The extension property is an instance of the ContextExtension class, which represents prover-defined key-value pairs that may be used inside a script. The validationSettings property is used to detect soft-fork conditions. The costLimit property is a hard limit on accumulated execution cost, and the initCost property is the initial value of execution cost already accumulated before Interpreter.verify (or prove) is called. The activatedScriptVersion property defines the maximum version of ErgoTree currently activated on the network. \n\nThe InterpreterContext trait also defines several methods to create a new instance with updated properties, including withErgoTreeVersion, withCostLimit, withInitCost, withExtension, withBindings, and withValidationSettings. The toSigmaContext method creates a special.sigma.Context instance based on this context, which contains all data represented using types from the special.sigma package.

What is the purpose of the `ContextExtension` class and how is it used in the script?\n- The `ContextExtension` class is used to store user-defined variables that can be accessed from a script using `getVar[T](id)` operation. The value of the variable is represented by a `Constant` instance, which contains both data value and `SType` descriptor. The descriptor is checked against the type `T` expected in the script operation.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `InterpreterContext` trait and what are some of its key properties?\n- The `InterpreterContext` trait is the base class of the context passed to verifier and prover. Some of its key properties include `extension` which stores prover-defined key-value pairs that may be used inside a script, `validationSettings` which are validation parameters passed to `Interpreter.verify` to detect soft-fork conditions, `costLimit` which is a hard limit on accumulated execution cost, and `activatedScriptVersion` which is the maximum version of ErgoTree currently activated on the network.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `toSigmaContext` method and what does it do?\n- The `toSigmaContext` method creates a `special.sigma.Context` instance based on the current context. The created instance contains all data represented using types from the `special.sigma` package, which are used internally by ErgoTree interpreter. This method performs transformation from Ergo to internal Sigma representation of all context data. It can also take additional context variables which will be merged with those in the `extension` of the current instance, overriding existing bindings in case variable ids overlap.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/interpreter/InterpreterContext.md"}}],["281",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/interpreter/OperationDesc.scala)\n\nThe code defines a set of classes and traits that describe the cost of operations in the Ergo blockchain. The `OperationDesc` trait is an abstract class that defines the `operationName` method, which returns the name of the operation. There are three concrete classes that extend `OperationDesc`: `CompanionDesc`, `MethodDesc`, and `NamedDesc`. \n\n`CompanionDesc` is a case class that takes a `ValueCompanion` as a parameter and returns the `typeName` of the companion object as the `operationName`. `ValueCompanion` is a trait that defines methods for creating and parsing values of a specific type. \n\n`MethodDesc` is a case class that takes an `SMethod` as a parameter and returns the `opName` of the method as the `operationName`. `SMethod` is a class that represents an operation as a method. \n\n`NamedDesc` is a case class that takes a `String` as a parameter and returns the same `String` as the `operationName`. This is used for intermediate sub-operations that are present in the cost model but are not separate operations in the ErgoTree.\n\n`OperationCostInfo` is a case class that combines a `CostKind` and an `OperationDesc`. `CostKind` is a trait that defines the cost of an operation. \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to describe the cost of operations in the Ergo blockchain.

For example, a developer could use the `MethodDesc` class to estimate the cost of a specific method and optimize the code accordingly. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval method = SMethod(\"add\", Seq(IntConstant(1), IntConstant(2)))\nval methodDesc = MethodDesc(method)\nval costInfo = OperationCostInfo(ComputationalCost, methodDesc)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `OperationDesc` abstract class?\n   \n   `OperationDesc` is an abstract class that defines the common interface for operation descriptors. It provides a method `operationName` that returns the name of the operation.\n\n2. What are the different ways in which a costable operation can be described?\n   \n   A costable operation can be described in one of the following ways: (1) using `ValueCompanion`, (2) using `SMethod`, or (3) using a string name.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `OperationCostInfo` case class?\n   \n   `OperationCostInfo` is a case class that combines an operation descriptor (`opDesc`) with a cost kind (`costKind`).

It is used for generating proofs for ErgoTree scripts, which are then used to validate transactions on the Ergo blockchain.\n\nThe main methods provided by this trait are:\n\n- `generateCommitments`: Generates commitments for a given ErgoTree or SigmaBoolean using the prover's secrets.\n- `prove`: Generates a proof for a given ErgoTree, context, and message, using the prover's secrets and optional hints.\n- `signMessage`: Signs an arbitrary message under a key representing a statement provable via a sigma-protocol.\n\nThe `ProverInterpreter` trait also defines several helper methods and strategies for generating proofs, such as `markReal`, `polishSimulated`, `simulateAndCommit`, and `proving`. These methods are used in the main `prove` method to perform various steps of the proving process, such as marking nodes as real or simulated, generating challenges for simulated nodes, and computing commitments and responses for real nodes.\n\nHere's an example of how the `ProverInterpreter` trait might be used in a larger project:\n\n```scala\nval prover = new MyProverInterpreter(secrets) // MyProverInterpreter extends ProverInterpreter\nval ergoTree = ... // An ErgoTree script to prove\nval context = ... // A context for the script\nval message = ... // A message to sign\n\nval result = prover.prove(ergoTree, context, message) match {\n  case Success(proof) => // Use the proof for validation or other purposes\n  case Failure(e) => // Handle the error\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a custom implementation of `ProverInterpreter` called `MyProverInterpreter` is used to generate a proof for a given ErgoTree script, context, and message. The resulting proof can then be used for validation or other purposes.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ProverInterpreter` trait?\n   **Answer**: The `ProverInterpreter` trait is an interpreter with enhanced functionality to prove statements. It is responsible for generating commitments, proving statements, and signing messages under a key representing a statement provable via a sigma-protocol.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `prove` method work in the `ProverInterpreter` trait?\n   **Answer**: The `prove` method takes an ErgoTree, a context, a message, and a hints bag as input. It performs a series of steps to reduce the ErgoTree to a crypto-tree, generate commitments, simulate and commit, and compute challenges and responses for real and simulated nodes. Finally, it outputs a `CostedProverResult` containing the proof, context extension, and cost.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the role of the `HintsBag` in the `ProverInterpreter` trait?\n   **Answer**: The `HintsBag` is used to store additional hints for a signer, which can be useful for distributed signing.

These classes are used to represent the result of a proof of correctness of transaction spending in the Sigma protocol. \n\nThe `ProverResult` class takes two parameters: `proof`, which is an array of bytes representing the proof that satisfies the final Sigma proposition, and `extension`, which is a user-defined variable to be put into context. The `CostedProverResult` class extends `ProverResult` and adds a `cost` parameter, which represents the cost of the proof. \n\nThe `ProverResult` class overrides the `hashCode`, `equals`, and `toString` methods. The `hashCode` method calculates the hash code of the `proof` and `extension` parameters using the `util.Arrays.hashCode` method. The `equals` method checks if the object being compared is the same as `this` or if it is an instance of `ProverResult` with the same `proof` and `extension` parameters. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the `ProverResult` object, including the `proof` and `extension` parameters encoded in Base16.\n\nThe `ProverResult` object provides an `empty` method that returns an empty `ProverResult` object with an empty `proof` and `extension`. It also provides a `serializer` object that extends the `SigmaSerializer` trait. The `serializer` object provides methods to serialize and parse `ProverResult` objects. The `serialize` method writes the `proof` parameter to the `SigmaByteWriter` object `w` along with its length and then calls the `serialize` method of the `ContextExtension` object `extension`. The `parse` method reads the `proof` parameter from the `SigmaByteReader` object `r` along with its length and then calls the `parse` method of the `ContextExtension` object `extension`.\n\nThe `CostedProverResult` class extends `ProverResult` and adds a `cost` parameter. It takes the same parameters as `ProverResult` and calls the constructor of `ProverResult` with the `proof` and `extension` parameters.

The trait extends the `Interpreter` trait, which provides methods for evaluating ErgoScript expressions.\n\nThe `generateCommitmentsFor` method takes an `ErgoTree` and a `CTX` (context) and generates commitments for all the public keys provided. The method first reduces the given tree to a crypto-tree (sigma-tree) using the provided context. Then, it generates commitments for the public keys using the `generateCommitmentsFor` method that takes a `SigmaBoolean` and a sequence of `SigmaBoolean` public keys. Currently, only keys in the form of `ProveDlog` and `ProveDiffieHellman` are supported, not more complex subtrees.\n\nThe `generateCommitmentsFor` method that takes a `SigmaBoolean` and a sequence of `SigmaBoolean` public keys generates commitments (private, containing secret randomness, and public, containing only commitments) for all the public keys provided. The method traverses the sigma-tree and generates commitments for the public keys that match the keys in the `generateFor` sequence. The method uses the `DLogInteractiveProver` and `DiffieHellmanTupleInteractiveProver` classes to generate commitments for `ProveDlog` and `ProveDHTuple` public keys, respectively.\n\nThe `bagForMultisig` method extracts partial proofs of secret knowledge for particular secrets with their respective public images given. The method takes a `CTX`, an `ErgoTree`, a signature for the key, and sequences of `SigmaBoolean` public keys for real and simulated proofs. The method first reduces the given tree to a crypto-tree (sigma-tree) using the provided context. Then, it generates a proof tree using the `computeCommitments` method and the `SigSerializer` class.

This can be useful in optimizing the execution of smart contracts on a blockchain by limiting their resource consumption.\n\nThe `CostDetails` class and its subclasses provide an abstract representation of cost results obtained during evaluation, allowing for flexible and extensible manipulation of cost results. This can be used to optimize the performance of ErgoTree operations and reduce the computational cost of evaluating complex scripts.\n\nThe `Interpreter` trait serves as a base verifying interpreter for ErgoTrees, responsible for evaluating ErgoTree expressions in a given context and verifying them.

These functions are organized into global, infix, unary, and special functions, and are used to perform various operations such as logical, arithmetic, and bitwise operations, as well as working with collections, authenticated dictionaries (AVL trees), and cryptographic primitives.\n\nFor example, the `AllOfFunc` function checks if all elements in a collection are true, while the `Blake2b256Func` function calculates the Blake2b hash of a given input byte array. These predefined functions are organized in a `PredefinedFuncRegistry` class, which maps function names to their corresponding implementations and metadata.\n\nThe code also provides a way to create and manipulate ErgoTree nodes, which represent the structure of a smart contract. This is done through the `IrBuilderFunc` type, which is a partial function that takes an `SValue` and a sequence of `SValue`s as input and returns an `SValue`.

This method works by splitting the input string into lines, scanning through the lines to determine the start and end indices of each line, and then finding the line containing the given index. If the index is not found within any line, the method returns a `SourceContext` object representing the last character of the last line.\n\nThe second method, `fromParserFailure`, takes a `Failure` object as an argument and returns a `SourceContext` object representing the location of the code that caused the failure.

The code also provides utility functions for type unification, substitution, and finding the most specific generalized type of a sequence of types, which are used during the compilation and type checking of ErgoTree expressions.\n\nOverall, the code in this folder is essential for the proper functioning of the ErgoTree language and the Ergo platform, as it defines the structure and behavior of various nodes, provides utility functions for type manipulation, and offers predefined functions for common operations in ErgoScript.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/summary.md"}}],["290",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/ApplySerializer.scala)\n\nThe code above is a part of the Sigmastate project and is responsible for serializing and deserializing Apply operations. The Apply operation is used to apply a function to a sequence of arguments. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to convert Apply operations into a byte stream that can be transmitted over a network or stored in a file.\n\nThe ApplySerializer class is a subclass of ValueSerializer and takes a constructor argument called cons, which is a function that takes a Value of SType and an IndexedSeq of Values of SType and returns a Value of SType.

A `BlockValue` is a value that represents a block of code in the Sigmastate language. It consists of a sequence of `BlockItem` objects and a result expression of type `SType`. The `BlockValueSerializer` takes a constructor function as a parameter that is used to create a new `BlockValue` object from the deserialized data.\n\nThe `serialize` method of the `BlockValueSerializer` writes the `BlockValue` object to a `SigmaByteWriter` object. It first writes the length of the `items` sequence as a variable-length quantity (VLQ) using the `putUInt` method of the `SigmaByteWriter`. It then iterates over the `items` sequence and writes each `BlockItem` object using the `putValue` method of the `SigmaByteWriter`. Finally, it writes the result expression using the `putValue` method.\n\nThe `parse` method of the `BlockValueSerializer` reads a `BlockValue` object from a `SigmaByteReader` object. It first reads the length of the `items` sequence as a VLQ using the `getUIntExact` method of the `SigmaByteReader`. If the length is zero, it returns a `BlockValue` object with an empty sequence of `BlockItem` objects. Otherwise, it allocates a new array of `BlockItem` objects using the `safeNewArray` method of the `sigmastate.util` package and reads each `BlockItem` object using the `getValue` method of the `SigmaByteReader`. Finally, it reads the result expression using the `getValue` method and calls the constructor function with the `items` sequence and the result expression as arguments to create a new `BlockValue` object.\n\nThis class is used in the larger Sigmastate project to serialize and deserialize `BlockValue` objects for storage and transmission. For example, it may be used to store a `BlockValue` object in a database or to transmit it over a network. Here is an example of how to use the `BlockValueSerializer` to serialize and deserialize a `BlockValue` object:\n\n```\nval items = IndexedSeq(BlockItem.Const(ConstantNode(1)), BlockItem.Const(ConstantNode(2)))\nval result = IntConstant(3)\nval blockValue = BlockValue(items, result)\n\nval serializer = BlockValueSerializer(BlockValue.apply)\nval writer = new SigmaByteWriter()\nserializer.serialize(blockValue, writer)\nval bytes = writer.toBytes\n\nval reader = SigmaByteReader(bytes)\nval deserialized = serializer.parse(reader).asInstanceOf[BlockValue]\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The case object is the actual object to be serialized. \n\nThe class extends the ValueSerializer trait, which provides methods for serializing and deserializing values. However, in this case, the serialize method is overridden to do nothing, as case objects do not need to be serialized. The parse method is also overridden to simply return the original case object, as it does not need to be deserialized. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to serialize and deserialize case objects that extend the Value trait. For example, if there is a case object representing a boolean value, it can be serialized using this code and then sent over a network or stored in a database. When it needs to be used again, it can be deserialized using this code. \n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```\nimport sigmastate.Values._\nimport sigmastate.serialization._\n\ncase object MyBoolean extends BoolConstant(false)\n\nval serializer = CaseObjectSerialization(BoolConstant, MyBoolean)\n\nval writer = new SigmaByteWriter()\nserializer.serialize(MyBoolean, writer)\nval bytes = writer.toBytes\n\nval reader = new SigmaByteReader(bytes)\nval deserialized = serializer.parse(reader)\n\nassert(deserialized == MyBoolean)\n```\n\nIn this example, a case object representing a boolean value is created and then serialized using the CaseObjectSerialization class. The resulting bytes can then be sent over a network or stored in a database. When the value is needed again, it can be deserialized using the same serializer. The deserialized value should be equal to the original value.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `deserializeColl` method?\n- The `deserializeColl` method is used to deserialize a collection of data values of a given type. It takes in the length of the collection, the type of the elements in the collection, and a `SigmaByteReader` object, and returns a `Coll` object containing the deserialized data values.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/DataSerializer.md"}}],["301",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/ErgoTreeSerializer.scala)\n\nThe `ErgoTreeSerializer` class is responsible for serializing and deserializing ErgoTree instances, which represent the spending conditions of a transaction output in the Ergo platform. ErgoTree instances can be serialized with or without a size bit, and with or without constant segregation. The class provides methods for serializing and deserializing ErgoTree instances, as well as methods for substituting constants in a serialized ErgoTree.\n\nThe `serializeErgoTree` method takes an ErgoTree instance and returns its serialized representation as an array of bytes. If the ErgoTree instance has an UnparsedErgoTree as its root, the original bytes are returned. Otherwise, the header, constants, and root of the ErgoTree are serialized.\n\nThe `deserializeErgoTree` method takes an array of bytes and returns the corresponding ErgoTree instance. It first deserializes the header and optional size, then deserializes the constants and the root of the ErgoTree. If a ValidationException is thrown during deserialization, an UnparsedErgoTree is created with the original bytes and the exception.\n\nThe `substituteConstants` method takes a serialized ErgoTree with segregated constants, an array of positions, and an array of new constant values. It returns a new serialized ErgoTree with the constants at the specified positions replaced with the new values. This method is useful for using serialized scripts as pre-defined templates.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval ergoTree: ErgoTree = ...\nval serializer = ErgoTreeSerializer.DefaultSerializer\n\n// Serialize ErgoTree\nval serialized: Array[Byte] = serializer.serializeErgoTree(ergoTree)\n\n// Deserialize ErgoTree\nval deserialized: ErgoTree = serializer.deserializeErgoTree(serialized)\n\n// Substitute constants\nval positions: Array[Int] = Array(0, 2)\nval newVals: Array[Constant[SType]] = Array(c1, c2)\nval (newBytes, len) = serializer.substituteConstants(serialized, positions, newVals)\n```\n\nThe rationale for soft-forkable ErgoTree serialization is explained in the comments, detailing how the header version check and size bit can be used to handle soft forks and maintain consensus.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ErgoTreeSerializer` class?\n   **Answer**: The `ErgoTreeSerializer` class is responsible for serializing and deserializing ErgoTree objects, which represent the structure of Ergo smart contracts. It also provides methods for substituting constants in the serialized ErgoTree, allowing for efficient script templates.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `substituteConstants` method work and what is its purpose?\n   **Answer**: The `substituteConstants` method takes a serialized ErgoTree with segregated constants, an array of positions, and an array of new constant values. It replaces the constants at the specified positions with the new values, allowing for the use of serialized scripts as pre-defined templates. This method is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of positions and m is the number of constants.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the rationale behind the soft-forkable ErgoTree serialization?\n   **Answer**: The soft-forkable ErgoTree serialization allows for the possibility of upgrading the protocol without causing a hard fork. It ensures that nodes with different versions can still parse and validate scripts, and that the decision about a soft-fork can be made later. This is achieved by checking the content of the script against the version number in the header during deserialization and enforcing certain rules based on the version numbers of the nodes and the script.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/ErgoTreeSerializer.md"}}],["302",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/FuncValueSerializer.scala)\n\nThe code above is a Scala implementation of a serializer for the FuncValue class in the Sigmastate project. The FuncValue class represents a function value in the Sigmastate language, which is a typed functional language used for smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain. The purpose of this serializer is to convert a FuncValue object into a byte array that can be transmitted over the network or stored on disk, and to deserialize a byte array back into a FuncValue object.\n\nThe FuncValueSerializer class is a subclass of the ValueSerializer class, which is a generic serializer for all types of values in Sigmastate. The FuncValueSerializer overrides the serialize and parse methods of the ValueSerializer class to handle the serialization and deserialization of FuncValue objects. The serialize method takes a FuncValue object and a SigmaByteWriter object as input, and writes the serialized byte array to the SigmaByteWriter. The parse method takes a SigmaByteReader object as input, reads the byte array from the SigmaByteReader, and returns a FuncValue object.\n\nThe FuncValueSerializer class defines several DataInfo objects that describe the format of the serialized byte array. These DataInfo objects include information about the number of function arguments, the identifier and type of each argument, and the function body. The serialize method uses these DataInfo objects to write the serialized byte array in the correct format.

The SigmaState project is a framework for building smart contracts on top of the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The GetVar operation retrieves a context variable from the current state of the UTXO. \n\nThe GetVarSerializer class is responsible for serializing and deserializing instances of the GetVar operation. It takes a constructor function as a parameter that is used to create a new instance of the GetVar operation during deserialization. The class extends the ValueSerializer trait, which is a generic serializer for SigmaState values. \n\nThe serialize method takes a GetVar instance and a SigmaByteWriter instance as parameters. It writes the variable ID and the expected type of the context variable to the SigmaByteWriter.

This is an important functionality in the larger project as elliptic curve cryptography is used extensively. \n\nThe serializer encodes every point in compressed form, meaning only the X coordinate and the sign of Y are stored. For secp256k1 point, 33 bytes are needed. The first byte indicates whether the Y coordinate is positive or negative (2 for positive, 3 for negative), while the other 32 bytes contain the X coordinate. The special case of an infinity point is encoded by 33 zeroes. Therefore, every elliptic curve point is always encoded with 33 bytes.\n\nThe `serialize` method takes an elliptic curve point and a `SigmaByteWriter` object as input. If the point is an infinity point, it writes the pre-defined `identityPointEncoding` to the writer. Otherwise, it normalizes the point, determines the sign of Y, gets the encoded X coordinate, and creates a new byte array `PO` of length `X.length + 1`. It sets the first byte of `PO` to 0x03 if the Y sign is negative, and 0x02 otherwise. It then copies the X coordinate to the remaining bytes of `PO`. Finally, it writes `PO` to the writer.\n\nThe `parse` method takes a `SigmaByteReader` object as input and returns an elliptic curve point. It reads `encodingSize` bytes from the reader and checks if the first byte is zero. If it is not zero, it decodes the point using the `decodePoint` method of the `curve` object. Otherwise, it returns the identity point of the curve.\n\nThe `parse` method is also overloaded to take an array of bytes as input.

The getValue method of the SigmaByteReader object is used to read Sigmastate values from the byte stream. \n\nOverall, the OptionGetOrElseSerializer class is an important part of the Sigmastate serialization package and is used to serialize and deserialize the OptionGetOrElse operation. It provides a custom serialization format for the operation, which is optimized for size and efficiency. Developers working with the Sigmastate language can use this class to serialize and deserialize OptionGetOrElse objects as needed. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval input: Value[SOption[SType]] = SOption[Int](Some(5))\nval default: Value[SType] = IntConstant(0)\nval op: OptionGetOrElse[SType] = OptionGetOrElse(input, default)\nval serializer: OptionGetOrElseSerializer = OptionGetOrElseSerializer(op.cons)\nval writer: SigmaByteWriter = new SigmaByteWriter()\nserializer.serialize(op, writer)\nval bytes: Array[Byte] = writer.toBytes\n\n// Deserialize bytes back to OptionGetOrElse object\nval reader: SigmaByteReader = SigmaByteReader(bytes)\nval deserializedOp: OptionGetOrElse[SType] = serializer.parse(reader).asInstanceOf[OptionGetOrElse[SType]]\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

A `PropertyCall` is a type of `MethodCall` that represents a call to a property of an object. \n\nThe `PropertyCallSerializer` class extends the `ValueSerializer` class and overrides its methods to provide serialization and deserialization functionality for `PropertyCall` objects. The `serialize` method takes a `MethodCall` object and a `SigmaByteWriter` object as input and writes the serialized data to the `SigmaByteWriter`. The `parse` method takes a `SigmaByteReader` object as input and reads the serialized data from it to create a `PropertyCall` object.\n\nThe `PropertyCallSerializer` class has a constructor that takes a function as input. This function is used to create a `Value` object from the deserialized data. The `cons` function takes four arguments: a `Value` object representing the receiver object of the property call, an `SMethod` object representing the method being called, a sequence of `Value` objects representing the arguments to the method call, and an `STypeSubst` object representing the type substitutions for the method call.\n\nThe `PropertyCallSerializer` class also defines three `DataInfo` objects that provide information about the serialized data. The `typeCodeInfo` object represents the type of the method being called, the `methodCodeInfo` object represents the code of the property being called, and the `objInfo` object represents the receiver object of the property call.\n\nThe `PropertyCallSerializer` class is used in the larger project to serialize and deserialize `PropertyCall` objects. For example, if the project needs to store `PropertyCall` objects in a database or send them over a network, the `PropertyCallSerializer` class can be used to serialize the objects into a byte stream and deserialize them back into `PropertyCall` objects. \n\nHere is an example of how the `PropertyCallSerializer` class can be used to serialize and deserialize a `PropertyCall` object:\n\n```\nval propertyCall = PropertyCall(receiverObject, method, arguments)\nval serializer = PropertyCallSerializer(consFunction)\nval writer = new SigmaByteWriter()\nserializer.serialize(propertyCall, writer)\nval bytes = writer.toBytes()\n\n// Deserialize the bytes back into a PropertyCall object\nval reader = new SigmaByteReader(bytes)\nval deserializedPropertyCall = serializer.parse(reader)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

This module is responsible for serializing and deserializing various types of objects used in the Sigmastate language. The code defines two serializer classes, ProveDlogSerializer and CreateProveDlogSerializer, which are used to serialize and deserialize objects of type ProveDlog and CreateProveDlog, respectively.\n\nProveDlog is a cryptographic primitive used in the Sigmastate language to represent a discrete logarithm proof of knowledge. It is implemented using elliptic curve cryptography and is used to prove that a given value is a valid public key. The ProveDlogSerializer class takes a constructor argument of type EcPointType => ProveDlog, which is used to create a new instance of ProveDlog. The serialize method of this class serializes the value of the ProveDlog object using the GroupElementSerializer class, which is responsible for serializing and deserializing elliptic curve points. The parse method of this class deserializes the value of the ProveDlog object using the GroupElementSerializer class and returns a new instance of ProveDlog using the constructor argument.\n\nCreateProveDlog is an operation in the Sigmastate language that creates a ProveDlog object from a given SGroupElement value. The CreateProveDlogSerializer class takes a constructor argument of type Value[SGroupElement.type] => SigmaPropValue, which is used to create a new instance of SigmaPropValue from a given SGroupElement value. The serialize method of this class serializes the value of the CreateProveDlog object using the SigmaByteWriter class, which is responsible for writing data to a byte stream. The parse method of this class deserializes the value of the CreateProveDlog object using the SigmaByteReader class, which is responsible for reading data from a byte stream, and returns a new instance of SigmaPropValue using the constructor argument.\n\nOverall, these serializer classes are used to serialize and deserialize ProveDlog and CreateProveDlog objects in the Sigmastate language. They are an important part of the Sigmastate serialization module and are used extensively throughout the project. Below is an example of how the CreateProveDlogSerializer class can be used to serialize a CreateProveDlog object:\n\n```\nval value = SGroupElement.random()\nval createProveDlog = CreateProveDlog(value)\nval serializer = CreateProveDlogSerializer((v: Value[SGroupElement.type]) => SigmaDsl.SigmaProp(v))\nval bytes = SigmaSerializer.startWriter().putValue(createProveDlog, serializer).toBytes\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the relationship between `ProveDlogSerializer` and `CreateProveDlogSerializer`?\n   \n   `ProveDlogSerializer` is used by `CreateProveDlogSerializer` to serialize and deserialize the `ProveDlog` object that is used as an argument to `CreateProveDlog`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/ProveDlogSerializer.md"}}],["314",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/SelectFieldSerializer.scala)\n\nThe code above is a Scala implementation of a serializer for the SelectField operation in the SigmaState project. The SelectField operation is used to select a specific field from a tuple. The purpose of this serializer is to convert a SelectField object into a byte stream that can be transmitted over a network or stored in a file. \n\nThe code imports several classes and objects from the SigmaState project, including SelectFieldInfo, Value, SValue, STuple, SType, and SigmaByteReader/SigmaByteWriter. It also defines a case class called SelectFieldSerializer that extends the ValueSerializer trait for SelectField objects. The constructor for SelectFieldSerializer takes a function that creates a new Value object from a tuple and a byte representing the index of the selected field. \n\nThe SelectFieldSerializer class overrides two methods from the ValueSerializer trait: serialize and parse. The serialize method takes a SelectField object and a SigmaByteWriter object and writes the input value and field index to the writer using the putValue and put methods, respectively. The parse method takes a SigmaByteReader object and reads the input value and field index from the reader. It then calls the constructor function to create a new Value object from the tuple and field index. \n\nThis serializer can be used in the larger SigmaState project to serialize and deserialize SelectField objects for transmission over a network or storage in a file. For example, if a user wants to select a specific field from a tuple and send it to another node in the network, they can use the SelectField operation and then serialize the resulting SelectField object using this serializer. The resulting byte stream can then be transmitted over the network or stored in a file. On the receiving end, the byte stream can be deserialized using this serializer to recreate the original SelectField object.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It does this by calling the putValue method of the SigmaByteWriter object and passing in the input of the SigmaPropBytes object and the thisInfo field.\n\nThe parse method in the SigmaPropBytesSerializer object takes a SigmaByteReader object as input and reads the serialized form of a SigmaPropBytes object from the SigmaByteReader object.

Are there any potential issues or limitations with this code?\n   - One potential issue with this code is that it assumes that the input `SigmaPropBytes` object has a non-null `input` field, which could cause a `NullPointerException` if this assumption is not met.

This is important because SigmaPropIsProven objects are used in the Sigmastate language to represent proofs of ownership of assets in the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model.

The Sigma protocol is a privacy-preserving smart contract platform that allows for the creation of complex contracts with advanced privacy features.\n\nThe `SigmaSerializer` object contains helper functions for reading and writing bytes to and from a `SigmaByteReader` and `SigmaByteWriter`, respectively. These functions are used in the serialization and deserialization of objects in the Sigma protocol. The `startReader` function takes an array of bytes and an optional starting position and returns a `SigmaByteReader` object that can be used to read values from the byte array. The `startWriter` function returns a `SigmaByteWriter` object that can be used to write values to a byte array.\n\nThe `SigmaSerializer` abstract class is a base class for all Sigma serializers. It defines two abstract methods: `serialize` and `parse`. The `serialize` method takes an object of type `T` and a `SigmaByteWriter` object and writes the object to the writer. The `parse` method takes a `SigmaByteReader` object and returns an object of type `TFamily`. The `SigmaSerializer` class also provides implementations for the `toBytes` and `fromBytes` methods, which use the `serialize` and `parse` methods to serialize and deserialize objects.\n\nThe `SigmaSerializerCompanion` trait is a companion object for Sigma serializers.

What is the significance of the type parameters LIV, RIV, and OV?\n- LIV and RIV represent the left and right input types of the two-argument operation, while OV represents the output type. These type parameters are used to ensure type safety and correctness in the serialization process.\n\n3. How does the constructor parameter relate to the serialization process?\n- The constructor parameter is used to create a new instance of the two-argument operation from the deserialized input values. It is necessary for the deserialization process to be able to reconstruct the original operation.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/TwoArgumentsSerializer.md"}}],["322",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/TypeSerializer.scala)\n\nThe `TypeSerializer` object provides serialization and deserialization functionality for types in the `sigmastate` package. The purpose of this code is to enable efficient encoding and decoding of types in the Ergo platform. \n\nThe `TypeSerializer` object contains two main methods: `serialize` and `deserialize`. The `serialize` method takes an `SType` object and a `SigmaByteWriter` object as input, and writes the serialized form of the type to the writer. The `deserialize` method takes a `SigmaByteReader` object as input, and reads the serialized form of a type from the reader and returns the corresponding `SType` object.\n\nThe `TypeSerializer` object also defines a number of constants and helper methods that are used in the serialization and deserialization process. For example, the `embeddableIdToType` array maps integer codes to embeddable types, which are types that can be combined with a type constructor for optimized encoding. The `getEmbeddableType` method takes an integer code as input and returns the corresponding embeddable type.\n\nThe `serialize` method handles different types of `SType` objects in different ways. For example, if the input type is an `SEmbeddable` type, the method writes the type code to the writer. If the input type is an `SCollectionType`, the method writes the collection type code to the writer and recursively calls `serialize` on the element type. If the input type is an `STuple`, the method writes the tuple type code to the writer and recursively calls `serialize` on each element type.\n\nThe `deserialize` method reads the type code from the reader and uses it to determine the type of the serialized object. It then constructs and returns the corresponding `SType` object. The method handles different types of type codes in different ways, similar to the `serialize` method.\n\nOverall, the `TypeSerializer` object is an important component of the Ergo platform that enables efficient encoding and decoding of types. It is used extensively throughout the platform to serialize and deserialize types for storage and transmission.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `TypeSerializer` object?\n- The `TypeSerializer` object is responsible for serializing and deserializing types according to the specification in `TypeSerialization.md`.\n\n2. What types can be represented by a single byte in the `embeddableIdToType` array?\n- The `embeddableIdToType` array contains embeddable types such as `SBoolean`, `SByte`, `SShort`, `SInt`, `SLong`, `SBigInt`, `SGroupElement`, and `SSigmaProp` that can be combined with a type constructor for optimized encoding.\n\n3. How are tuple types with more than 4 items serialized?\n- Tuple types with more than 4 items are serialized by calling the `serializeTuple` method, which writes the tuple type code, the number of items in the tuple, and then recursively serializes each item in the tuple.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/TypeSerializer.md"}}],["323",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/ValDefSerializer.scala)\n\nThe ValDefSerializer class is responsible for serializing and deserializing ValDef objects, which represent variable definitions in the Sigma programming language. This class extends the ValueSerializer class and takes a ValueCompanion object as a parameter. \n\nThe serialize method takes a ValDef object and a SigmaByteWriter object as parameters. It first writes the id of the ValDef object to the writer. Then, if the opcode is FunDefCode, it writes the type arguments of the ValDef object to the writer. The type arguments are written as a byte indicating the number of arguments, followed by the arguments themselves. Finally, the method writes the right-hand side of the ValDef object to the writer.\n\nThe parse method takes a SigmaByteReader object as a parameter and returns a Value object of type SType. It first reads the id of the ValDef object from the reader. Then, if the opcode is FunDefCode, it reads the type arguments of the ValDef object from the reader. The type arguments are read as a byte indicating the number of arguments, followed by the arguments themselves. Finally, the method reads the right-hand side of the ValDef object from the reader and creates a new ValDef object with the id, type arguments, and right-hand side.\n\nOverall, the ValDefSerializer class is an important component of the serialization process for ValDef objects in the Sigma programming language. It allows for the efficient transfer of ValDef objects between different parts of the larger project, such as between nodes in a distributed system. Here is an example of how the ValDefSerializer class might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nval myValDef = ValDef(1, Seq(STypeInt), IntConstant(42))\nval serializer = ValDefSerializer(FunDef)\nval writer = new SigmaByteWriter()\nserializer.serialize(myValDef, writer)\nval bytes = writer.toBytes\n\n// ... transfer bytes to another part of the project ...\n\nval reader = new SigmaByteReader(bytes)\nval deserialized = serializer.parse(reader)\nassert(deserialized == myValDef)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What other classes or functions does this code interact with?\n   \n   This code imports several classes and functions from the Sigmastate library, including ValueCompanion, ValueSerializer, SigmaByteReader, SigmaByteWriter, ValueSerializer, and safeNewArray. It also references several OpCodes defined in the same package.\n\n3. What is the expected format of the input and output data for this code?\n   \n   This code expects to receive ValDef objects as input, which contain an ID, type arguments, and a right-hand side value. It outputs bytes that represent the serialized ValDef object, and can also parse bytes back into a ValDef object. The format of the input and output data is specified by the SigmaByteReader and SigmaByteWriter classes.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/ValDefSerializer.md"}}],["324",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/ValDefTypeStore.scala)\n\nThe ValDefTypeStore class is a data structure used to store and retrieve SType objects. SType is a type hierarchy used in the Sigma protocol, which is a cryptographic protocol for secure transactions. \n\nThe ValDefTypeStore class uses a mutable Map to store SType objects, with the keys being integers and the values being SType objects. The apply method is used to retrieve an SType object from the store by its corresponding integer key. The update method is used to add or update an SType object in the store, with the integer key being provided as the first argument and the SType object being provided as the second argument.\n\nThis class may be used in the larger project to store and retrieve SType objects for use in the Sigma protocol. For example, if a new SType object is created during the execution of the protocol, it can be added to the ValDefTypeStore using the update method. Later on, if the SType object is needed again, it can be retrieved from the ValDefTypeStore using the apply method.\n\nHere is an example of how the ValDefTypeStore class might be used:\n\n```\nval store = new ValDefTypeStore()\nval tpe = SType.SInt\nstore.update(1, tpe)\nval retrievedTpe = store(1)\nassert(retrievedTpe == tpe)\n```\n\nIn this example, a new ValDefTypeStore object is created and an SInt object is added to the store with an integer key of 1 using the update method. The SInt object is then retrieved from the store using the apply method and stored in the retrievedTpe variable. Finally, an assertion is made to ensure that the retrieved SInt object is equal to the original SInt object.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the ValDefTypeStore class?\n   - The ValDefTypeStore class is used to store and retrieve SType objects based on their associated integer IDs.\n\n2. How are SType objects added to the store?\n   - SType objects are added to the store by calling the update method with an integer ID and the SType object to be stored.\n\n3. Is the store thread-safe?\n   - It is not clear from the code whether the store is thread-safe or not.

ValUse is a class that represents the use of a previously defined value in a Sigma protocol script. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to convert ValUse objects to and from bytes so that they can be transmitted over a network or stored in a database.\n\nThe ValUseSerializer class is a subclass of ValueSerializer, which is a generic serializer for all types of Sigma protocol values. The constructor of ValUseSerializer takes a function that creates a new instance of a Value object given an ID and a type. This function is used to deserialize ValUse objects.\n\nThe serialize method of ValUseSerializer takes a ValUse object and a SigmaByteWriter object and writes the ID of the referenced value to the writer. The parse method of ValUseSerializer takes a SigmaByteReader object and reads the ID of the referenced value from the reader. It then looks up the type of the referenced value in a type store and uses the constructor function to create a new ValUse object.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger Sigmastate project to serialize and deserialize ValUse objects in various contexts. For example, it can be used to transmit ValUse objects between nodes in a distributed Sigma protocol network or to store them in a database for later use.

It is an essential component for handling data serialization and deserialization in the Ergo platform, which is a blockchain-based platform that supports smart contracts.\n\nThe `ValueSerializer` class is an abstract class that extends the `SigmaSerializer` trait. It provides methods for serializing and deserializing values of type `Value[SType]`. The `ValueSerializer` object is a companion object that implements the `SigmaSerializerCompanion` trait and provides a collection of serializers for various types of values.\n\nThe `serializers` field is a `SparseArrayContainer` that holds a sequence of `ValueSerializer` instances for different types of values. These serializers are responsible for handling specific types of values, such as constants, tuples, relations, and various operations (e.g., arithmetic, bitwise, logical, etc.).\n\nThe `ValueSerializer` object also provides utility methods for handling optional values, cases, and loops during serialization and deserialization. These methods help in managing the complexity of the serialization process and make it easier to handle different types of values.\n\nThe `serialize` and `deserialize` methods are the main entry points for serialization and deserialization. The `serialize` method takes a `Value[SType]` and a `SigmaByteWriter` as input and writes the serialized value to the writer. The `deserialize` method takes a `SigmaByteReader` as input and reads the serialized value from the reader, returning a `Value[SType]`.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `ValueSerializer`:\n\n```scala\nimport sigmastate.Values._\nimport sigmastate.serialization.ValueSerializer\n\nval value: Value[SType] = ... // some value\nval serialized: Array[Byte] = ValueSerializer.serialize(value)\nval deserialized: Value[SType] = ValueSerializer.deserialize(serialized)\n```\n\nIn summary, the `ValueSerializer` is a crucial component in the SigmaState project for handling the serialization and deserialization of Sigma protocol values. It provides a collection of serializers for various types of values and utility methods for managing the complexity of the serialization process.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ValueSerializer` class and its subclasses?\n   **Answer**: The `ValueSerializer` class is an abstract class that provides serialization and deserialization functionality for `Value[SType]` objects. Its subclasses are responsible for implementing the specific serialization and deserialization logic for different types of `Value[SType]` objects.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `ValueSerializer` handle the serialization of constants and placeholders?\n   **Answer**: The `ValueSerializer` handles the serialization of constants and placeholders by using the `constantSerializer` and `constantPlaceholderSerializer` instances. When serializing a value, it checks if the value is a constant or a placeholder and uses the appropriate serializer to serialize it.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `ValueSerializer` manage the complexity of the serialized objects?\n   **Answer**: The `ValueSerializer` manages the complexity of the serialized objects by using the `getComplexity` method, which returns the complexity value for the corresponding operation code. The `complexity` value is then added to the `SigmaByteReader` or `SigmaByteWriter` to keep track of the total complexity during serialization and deserialization.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/ValueSerializer.md"}}],["327",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/transformers/AppendSerializer.scala)\n\nThe code above is a Scala implementation of a serializer for the Append operation in the SigmaState project. The Append operation is used to concatenate two collections of the same type into a single collection. This serializer is responsible for converting an Append object into a byte stream that can be transmitted over a network or stored in a file.\n\nThe code imports several classes and objects from the SigmaState project, including AppendInfo, Value, SCollection, SType, and ValueSerializer. It also defines a case class called AppendSerializer that extends the ValueSerializer class and takes a constructor argument of type (Value[SCollection[SType]], Value[SCollection[SType]]) => Value[SCollection[SType]]. This constructor argument is a function that takes two collections of the same type and returns a new collection that is the concatenation of the two input collections.\n\nThe AppendSerializer class overrides two methods from the ValueSerializer class: opDesc and serialize. The opDesc method returns the Append object, which is the operation being serialized. The serialize method takes an Append object and a SigmaByteWriter object and writes the input and col2 collections to the byte stream using the putValue method of the SigmaByteWriter object.\n\nThe AppendSerializer class also defines a parse method that takes a SigmaByteReader object and returns a collection of the same type as the input and col2 collections. This method reads the input and col2 collections from the byte stream using the getValue method of the SigmaByteReader object and passes them to the constructor function defined in the AppendSerializer constructor.\n\nOverall, this serializer is an important component of the SigmaState project, as it allows Append objects to be transmitted and stored in a serialized format. It can be used in conjunction with other serializers and deserializers to enable the SigmaState system to communicate with other systems and store data in a variety of formats.

This function is used in the `parse` method to create a new `Value[SType]` from the deserialized data.\n\nThe `serialize` method takes an instance of `DeserializeRegister[SType]` and a `SigmaByteWriter` and writes the serialized bytes to the writer. The serialized bytes consist of the register number, the expected type of the deserialized script, and an optional default value. The `parse` method takes a `SigmaByteReader` and reads the serialized bytes to create a new instance of `Value[SType]`. It does this by reading the register number, the type, and the default value (if present) from the reader, and then calling the `cons` function to create a new `Value[SType]`.\n\nOverall, this serializer is an important component of the larger project because it allows instances of `DeserializeRegister` to be stored and transmitted as bytes. This is necessary for the operation to be used in the Ergo blockchain platform, where data must be serialized and deserialized for storage and transmission. An example of how this serializer might be used in the larger project is shown below:\n\n```\nval regId = RegisterId.R4\nval tpe = SType.SLong\nval defaultValue = Some(LongConstant(0))\nval deserializeReg = DeserializeRegister(regId, tpe, defaultValue)\nval serializer = DeserializeRegisterSerializer((regId, tpe, defaultValue) => LongConstant(0))\nval bytes = serializer.toBytes(deserializeReg)\nval deserializedReg = serializer.parseBytes(bytes)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

This function is used in the parse method to create a new ExtractRegisterAs object from the serialized data.\n\nThe serialize method takes an ExtractRegisterAs object and a SigmaByteWriter object as input.

What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a serializer for the `Slice` operation in the Sigma programming language, which extracts a sub-collection from a given collection.\n2.

How does this code handle serialization and deserialization of `Slice` objects?\n   - This code uses a `SigmaByteWriter` to serialize the `input`, `from`, and `until` values of a `Slice` object, and a `SigmaByteReader` to parse these values back into a `Slice` object using the `cons` constructor.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/transformers/SliceSerializer.md"}}],["343",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/.autodoc/docs/json/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/serialization/transformers)\n\nThe code in this folder provides serializers for various operations and transformers in the SigmaState project. Serializers are responsible for converting objects into byte streams that can be transmitted over a network or stored in a file, and deserializing them back into objects. These serializers are crucial for enabling communication between different parts of the SigmaState system and for storing data in various formats.\n\nFor example, the `AppendSerializer` class is responsible for serializing and deserializing the `Append` operation, which concatenates two collections of the same type. This serializer can be used in a smart contract that needs to concatenate two collections of data before performing some computation on the resulting collection.\n\nAnother example is the `AtLeastSerializer` class, which serializes and deserializes the `AtLeast` operation. This operation is used to create a `SigmaPropValue` representing a threshold signature scheme, requiring a minimum number of signatures from a collection of `SigmaPropValues` to be valid. The serializer allows `AtLeast` operations to be transmitted over the network or stored in a database.\n\nThe `BooleanTransformerSerializer` class provides serialization and deserialization for the `BooleanTransformer` class, which is used to transform a collection of values into a boolean value based on a given condition. This serializer can be used in various parts of the project to transform collections of values into boolean values based on a given condition.\n\nIn summary, the serializers in this folder play a crucial role in the SigmaState project by enabling the efficient transmission and storage of various operations and transformers.

The purpose of this serializer is to convert a Quadruple object into a byte stream that can be transmitted over a network or stored in a file, and vice versa. \n\nThe serializer is defined as a case class that takes four type parameters, S1, S2, S3, and S4, which represent the types of the four values stored in the Quadruple. The constructor of the serializer takes two arguments: an instance of a QuadrupleCompanion object, which provides metadata about the Quadruple, and a function that takes three Value objects of types S1, S2, and S3, and returns a Value object of type S4. \n\nThe serializer implements the ValueSerializer trait, which defines two methods: serialize and parse. The serialize method takes a Quadruple object and a SigmaByteWriter object, which is used to write the byte stream. The method first retrieves the DataInfo objects for the three values stored in the Quadruple from the QuadrupleCompanion object, and then writes each value to the byte stream using the putValue method of the SigmaByteWriter object. \n\nThe parse method takes a SigmaByteReader object, which is used to read the byte stream, and returns a Value object of type S4.

What is the significance of the cons parameter in the QuadrupleSerializer constructor?\n- The cons parameter is a function that takes three Value objects of types S1, S2, and S3 and returns a Value object of type S4.

The relation is represented by a function constructor that takes two values of types S1 and S2 and returns a value of type SBoolean. The serializer is used to convert the relation into a byte array that can be transmitted over a network or stored in a file.\n\nThe serializer is implemented as a case class that takes two arguments: an instance of a RelationCompanion object that describes the relation, and the constructor function that creates the relation. The serializer extends the ValueSerializer trait, which defines two methods: serialize and parse. The serialize method takes an instance of the relation and a SigmaByteWriter object, and writes the relation to the writer in a binary format. The parse method takes a SigmaByteReader object and returns an instance of the relation.\n\nThe serializer uses the opCodeInfo, bitsInfo, leftArgInfo, and rightArgInfo objects to define the format of the binary data. The opCodeInfo object is a DataInfo object that describes the opcode used to represent the relation. The bitsInfo object is a DataInfo object that describes the format of the two bits used to represent the relation. The leftArgInfo and rightArgInfo objects are DataInfo objects that describe the format of the two arguments to the relation.\n\nThe serializer uses the cases and when methods to define the different cases for serializing the relation. If the relation is a constant Boolean value, the serializer writes the opcode and the two bits to the writer. Otherwise, the serializer writes the two arguments to the writer.\n\nThe parse method uses the peekByte method to determine if the relation is a constant Boolean value. If it is, the method reads the two bits and creates an instance of the relation using the constructor function. Otherwise, the method reads the two arguments and creates an instance of the relation using the constructor function.\n\nOverall, this serializer is an important component of the larger project as it allows binary relations to be transmitted and stored in a compact and efficient format. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as in smart contracts or cryptographic protocols, where binary relations are commonly used. An example of using this serializer would be in a smart contract that checks if a user has a certain amount of funds in their account before allowing them to make a transaction.

The `buildForSerializers` method in the companion object takes a list of `ValueSerializer` objects as input and returns a `SparseArrayContainer` object with the `ValueSerializer` objects stored in the array at the index corresponding to their OpCode.\n\n```scala\nval serializers = Seq(ValueSerializer1, ValueSerializer2, ValueSerializer3)\nval container = SparseArrayContainer.buildForSerializers(serializers)\n\nval serializer1 = container(ValueSerializer1.opCode)\n```\n\nOverall, the code in this folder provides essential utility functions and classes for the larger project, enabling serialization and deserialization of Sigma types and values, as well as conversion of numeric types to byte arrays and collections of Booleans.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/utils/summary.md"}}],["354",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/utxo/ComplexityTable.scala)\n\nThe `ComplexityTable` object in the `sigmastate.utxo` package is used to store the complexity values of various operations and method calls in the ErgoScript language. These complexity values are used to estimate the computational cost of executing a given ErgoScript, which is important for ensuring that scripts do not consume excessive resources during execution.\n\nThe `ComplexityTable` object contains two maps: `OpCodeComplexity` and `MethodCallComplexity`. The `OpCodeComplexity` map stores the complexity values for various operations, such as arithmetic, logical, and collection operations. The keys in this map are the operation codes (`OpCode`), and the values are the corresponding complexity values. The `MethodCallComplexity` map stores the complexity values for method calls on specific types, such as `AvlTree`, `SCollection`, and `Context`. The keys in this map are tuples of two bytes, where the first byte represents the type identifier and the second byte represents the method identifier. The values are the corresponding complexity values.\n\nFor example, the complexity of the `Fold` operation is 4034, and the complexity of the `AvlTree.update` method call is 3911. These values are used by the ErgoScript interpreter to estimate the total complexity of a given script, which can then be used to determine if the script is within acceptable resource limits for execution.\n\nHere's an example of how the complexity values might be used:\n\n```scala\nval scriptComplexity = script.operations.map(op => ComplexityTable.OpCodeComplexity(op.opCode)).sum +\n                       script.methodCalls.map(mc => ComplexityTable.MethodCallComplexity((mc.typeId, mc.methodId))).sum\nif (scriptComplexity > maxAllowedComplexity) {\n  // Reject the script as too complex\n} else {\n  // Execute the script\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the complexity values for all operations and method calls in the script are summed up, and the total complexity is compared against a predefined maximum allowed complexity. If the script's complexity exceeds the maximum, it is rejected; otherwise, it is executed.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ComplexityTable` object in this code?\n   **Answer**: The `ComplexityTable` object contains two maps, `OpCodeComplexity` and `MethodCallComplexity`, which store the complexity values for various opcodes and method calls used in the project. These values can be used to estimate the computational complexity of certain operations in the code.\n\n2. **Question**: How are the complexity values in the `OpCodeComplexity` and `MethodCallComplexity` maps determined?\n   **Answer**: The complexity values in the maps are hard-coded and seem to be based on some pre-determined analysis or benchmarking of the operations. The comments next to each entry indicate the count of occurrences for each operation, which might have been used to calculate the complexity values.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the significance of the `MinimalComplexity` constant in the code?\n   **Answer**: The `MinimalComplexity` constant is set to 100 and represents the minimum complexity value that can be assigned to an operation. This can be used as a baseline for comparing the complexity of different operations in the code.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/utxo/ComplexityTable.md"}}],["355",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/interpreter/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/utxo/ComplexityTableStat.scala)\n\nThe `ComplexityTableStat` object contains methods for tracking and reporting the execution times of op codes and method calls in the `sigmastate.utxo` package. \n\nThe `StatItem` class is a private mutable class that stores the count and sum of execution times for a given operation. The `opStat` and `mcStat` mutable hash maps store the execution times for op codes and method calls, respectively. \n\nThe `addOpTime` method takes an op code and execution time as input and updates the corresponding `StatItem` in `opStat`. If the op code is not already in `opStat`, a new `StatItem` is created and added to the map. \n\nThe `addMcTime` method takes a type ID, method ID, and execution time as input and updates the corresponding `StatItem` in `mcStat`. If the type ID and method ID are not already in `mcStat`, a new `StatItem` is created and added to the map. \n\nThe `complexityTableString` method generates a string representation of the execution times for op codes and method calls. It first generates a list of tuples containing the op code or method call name, ID, average execution time, and count. It then sorts the list by execution time in descending order. \n\nThe method then generates two separate lists of strings, one for op codes and one for method calls. Each string in the list contains the name or ID of the op code or method call, the average execution time in microseconds, and the count of executions. \n\nThe final output is a string containing the two lists of op codes and method calls, separated by a line of dashes. \n\nThis code can be used to analyze the performance of different operations and method calls in the `sigmastate.utxo` package. By calling the `addOpTime` and `addMcTime` methods at various points in the code, developers can track the execution times of specific operations and method calls. The `complexityTableString` method can then be used to generate a report of the execution times, which can be used to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n// track execution time of an op code\nval startTime = System.nanoTime()\n// execute op code\nval endTime = System.nanoTime()\nval elapsedTime = endTime - startTime\nComplexityTableStat.addOpTime(opCode, elapsedTime)\n\n// track execution time of a method call\nval startTime = System.nanoTime()\n// call method\nval endTime = System.nanoTime()\nval elapsedTime = endTime - startTime\nComplexityTableStat.addMcTime(typeId, methodId, elapsedTime)\n\n// generate report of execution times\nval report = ComplexityTableStat.complexityTableString\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the output format of the `complexityTableString` method?\n- The `complexityTableString` method outputs a formatted string that displays the average execution time and count for each op code and method call, sorted by decreasing execution time.

Similarly, the `Filter` case class takes an input collection and a condition function, and returns a new collection containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.\n\nOther transformers in this code include `Append`, `Slice`, `Exists`, `ForAll`, `Fold`, `ByIndex`, `SelectField`, `SigmaPropIsProven`, `SigmaPropBytes`, and various `Extract` operations for extracting specific fields from boxes, such as `ExtractAmount`, `ExtractScriptBytes`, `ExtractBytes`, `ExtractBytesWithNoRef`, `ExtractId`, and `ExtractCreationInfo`.\n\nAdditionally, there are operations for working with optional values, such as `OptionGet`, `OptionGetOrElse`, and `OptionIsDefined`, as well as operations for deserializing and working with context variables, like `DeserializeContext`, `DeserializeRegister`, and `GetVar`.\n\nThese transformers and operations are essential for processing and manipulating data within the Ergo platform, and they can be used in various parts of the project to perform complex data transformations and validations.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `Transformer` trait?**\n\n   The `Transformer` trait is used to represent operations that transform some input value of type `IV` into an output value of type `OV`. It is mainly used to simplify the implementation and avoid code duplication.\n\n2. **How does the `MapCollection` case class work?**\n\n   The `MapCollection` case class represents an operation that applies a given function `mapper` to all elements of an input collection and returns a new collection with the results.

The main focus of this package is to provide elliptic curve cryptography, hashing, and utility methods for working with byte arrays and strings. These utilities can be used for key generation, message signing, signature verification, and ensuring the security and integrity of cryptographic operations.\n\nThe `shared` subfolder contains essential components for working with Ergo addresses, ErgoBox, transaction inputs, and validation rules.

The `collectCoverage` property is a boolean that determines whether or not code coverage information should be collected during testing. If set to `true`, the framework will track which lines of code are executed during testing and generate a report showing how much of the codebase was covered. If set to `false`, no coverage information will be collected.\n\nThe `coverageProvider` property specifies which coverage analysis tool to use. In this case, it is set to \"v8\", which is the default coverage provider for Node.js. Other options include \"babel\" and \"babel-jest\", which are used for code written in the Babel transpiler.\n\nThe `moduleDirectories` property is an array of directories to search for modules when importing them in test files. By default, the framework will look in the `node_modules` directory, but this property allows for additional directories to be searched.\n\nThe `testMatch` property is an array of file patterns that determine which files should be considered test files. The patterns use glob syntax and include both `.js` and `.jsx` file extensions. The patterns include files located in the `__tests__` directory as well as files with names that end in \"spec\" or \"test\".\n\nOverall, this code provides configuration options for a testing framework, allowing developers to customize how tests are run and what information is collected during testing. It can be used in conjunction with other testing tools and libraries to create a comprehensive testing suite for a project.

The object is then spread into a new object, allowing us to modify some of its properties. In this case, we set `collectCoverage` to `true` and define a coverage threshold that must be met for the tests to pass. This modified configuration object is then exported and used by the testing framework to run tests and generate coverage reports.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What does the `collectCoverage` option do and why is it set to `false`?\n   The `collectCoverage` option determines whether code coverage information should be collected during testing. In this case, it is set to `false`, indicating that coverage information should not be collected.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `moduleDirectories` option?\n   The `moduleDirectories` option specifies directories to search for modules when importing them in test files.

It provides methods to parse ErgoScript code into ErgoTree expressions and SType (Sigma Type) objects. \n\nThe `SigmaParser` object imports several classes and objects from the `sigmastate.lang` package, including `Values`, `Nullable`, `Terms`, `Core`, and `Exprs`. It also imports `fastparse.internal.Logger` and `scala.collection.mutable` packages.\n\nThe `SigmaParser` object extends the `Exprs` trait, which defines methods for parsing ErgoScript expressions, and the `Types` trait, which defines methods for parsing ErgoScript types. It also extends the `Core` trait, which defines methods for constructing ErgoTree nodes.\n\nThe `SigmaParser` object overrides the `atSrcPos` and `srcCtx` methods from the `Exprs` trait. The `atSrcPos` method takes a parser index and a thunk and returns the result of the thunk with the current source context set to the source context at the given parser index. The `srcCtx` method takes a parser index and returns the source context at the given parser index.\n\nThe `SigmaParser` object defines the `ValVarDef` and `BlockDef` methods, which parse variable and block definitions, respectively. The `ValVarDef` method takes an index, a binding pattern, an optional type, and an expression, and returns a `Val` node with the given name, type, and body. The `BlockDef` method calls the `Dcl` method, which is defined in the `Core` trait.\n\nThe `SigmaParser` object defines the `mkUnaryOp` and `mkBinaryOp` methods, which construct ErgoTree nodes for unary and binary operations, respectively. The `mkUnaryOp` method takes an operator name and an argument and returns the result of applying the operator to the argument. The `mkBinaryOp` method takes a left operand, an operator name, and a right operand, and returns the result of applying the operator to the operands.\n\nThe `SigmaParser` object defines the `parseType` method, which takes a string representation of a type in ErgoScript syntax and returns an SType object. The `parseType` method calls the `parsedType` method, which parses the string into an SType object.\n\nThe `SigmaParser` object defines the `apply` method, which takes a string representation of ErgoScript code and returns a parsed ErgoTree expression. The `apply` method calls the `parse` method, which parses the code into an ErgoTree expression.\n\nOverall, the `SigmaParser` object provides a high-level interface for parsing ErgoScript code into ErgoTree expressions and SType objects. It can be used in the larger project to parse ErgoScript code and construct ErgoTree nodes. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval code = \"1 + 2\"\nval parsed = SigmaParser(code)\nval tree = parsed.get.value\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What types of operations are supported by the `mkUnaryOp` and `mkBinaryOp` methods?\n- The `mkUnaryOp` method supports prefix operations such as `-`, `!`, and `~`, while the `mkBinaryOp` method supports binary operations such as `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `-`, `|`, `&`, `/`, and `%`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `parseType` method?\n- The `parseType` method parses a string representation of a type in ErgoScript syntax into an `SType`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/SigmaParser.md"}}],["365",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/Types.scala)\n\n## Code Explanation: Types.scala\n\nThe `Types` trait provides parsers for type terms that can produce values of `SType`. The `SType` is a type of values in the ErgoTree IR. The parsers are used to parse type expressions in the ErgoScript language.\n\nThe trait defines the following parsers:\n\n- `TypeExpr`: Parses a typed expression and returns an expression of ErgoTree IR.\n- `ValVarDef`: Parses `name = expr` syntax and returns an instance of `ValNode`.\n- `Dcl`: Parses `val name = expr` syntax and returns an instance of `ValNode`.\n- `PostfixType`: Parses a postfix type expression and returns an instance of `SType`.\n- `Type`: Parses a type expression and returns an instance of `SType`.\n- `InfixType`: Parses an infix type expression and returns an instance of `SType`.\n- `CompoundType`: Parses a compound type expression and returns an instance of `SType`.\n- `AnnotType`: Parses an annotated type expression and returns an instance of `SType`.\n- `TypeId`: Parses a type identifier and returns an instance of `SType`.\n- `TypeArgs`: Parses type arguments and returns an instance of `SType`.\n- `SimpleType`: Parses a simple type expression and returns an instance of `SType`.\n- `FunSig`: Parses a function signature and returns a sequence of function arguments.\n- `DottyExtMethodSubj`: Parses an extension method subject.\n- `Annot`: Parses an annotation with optional arguments.\n\nThe trait also defines a `predefTypes` map that maps predefined type names to their corresponding `SType` instances. The `typeFromName` method is used to lookup a predefined type by name.\n\nThe `Types` trait is used in the larger project to parse type expressions in ErgoScript code. The parsed type expressions are used to type-check ErgoScript code and to generate ErgoTree IR. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval input = \"Int => Boolean\"\nval result = parse(input, Type(_))\nresult.get // returns SFunc(Array(SInt), SBoolean)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Types` trait?\n- The `Types` trait defines parsers for type terms that can produce values of `SType`, which is used in the ErgoTree IR.\n\n2. What is the `predefTypes` map used for?\n- The `predefTypes` map is used to lookup pre-defined types by name.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `InfixType` parser?\n- The `InfixType` parser is used to parse infix types, which are types that use infix operators such as `+` or `:`. It checks the associativity of the operators and builds the corresponding `SType` object.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/Types.md"}}],["366",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/.autodoc/docs/json/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang)\n\nThe `.autodoc/docs/json/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang` folder contains Scala code for parsing ErgoScript, a scripting language used in the Ergo blockchain platform.

It provides methods to parse ErgoScript code into ErgoTree expressions and SType (Sigma Type) objects. The `SigmaParser` object extends several traits, including `Exprs`, `Types`, and `Core`, which define methods for parsing ErgoScript expressions, types, and constructing ErgoTree nodes, respectively. Example usage:\n\n```scala\nval code = \"1 + 2\"\nval parsed = SigmaParser(code)\nval tree = parsed.get.value\n```\n\n`Types.scala` provides parsers for type terms that can produce values of `SType`.

Example usage:\n\n```scala\nval input = \"Int => Boolean\"\nval result = parse(input, Type(_))\nresult.get // returns SFunc(Array(SInt), SBoolean)\n```\n\nThe `syntax` subfolder contains several files for parsing ErgoScript:\n\n- `Basic.scala`: Provides parsers for basic lexical elements, such as numbers, operators, and keywords.\n- `Core.scala`: Defines a trait called \"Core\" that contains common aliases and keywords used in almost every parser in the file. It also provides methods for constructing ErgoTree unary and binary operations.\n- `Exprs.scala`: Defines a set of parsers for ErgoScript expressions, organized in a trait called `Exprs`. Example usage:\n\n  ```scala\n  val input = \"if (x > 0) x * 2 else x / 2\"\n  val parsedExpr = fastparse.parse(input, Exprs.Expr(_))\n  ```\n\n- `Identifiers.scala`: Provides functionality for parsing and identifying identifiers and keywords in the Sigma programming language.\n- `Literals.scala`: A collection of parsers for literal expressions used in the Sigma programming language.\n\nOverall, the code in this folder is crucial for parsing ErgoScript code and generating an AST, which can then be used for further processing, such as type checking, optimization, or code generation. The parsers are implemented using the FastParse library and are designed to work together to handle the various constructs and expressions found in ErgoScript.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/summary.md"}}],["367",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/syntax/Basic.scala)\n\nThe code provided is a Scala implementation of basic lexical parsers for ErgoScript, a scripting language used in the Ergo blockchain platform. The purpose of this code is to provide parsers for various types of tokens in ErgoScript, such as numbers, operators, and keywords. These parsers are used in the larger project to parse ErgoScript code and generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) that can be executed on the Ergo blockchain.\n\nThe `Basic` object contains parsers for various types of tokens. The `Digit` parser matches a decimal digit, while the `HexDigit` parser matches a hexadecimal digit. The `UnicodeEscape` parser matches a Unicode escape sequence, which is used to represent Unicode characters in ErgoScript. The `HexNum` parser matches a positive hexadecimal number, while the `DecNum` parser matches a positive decimal number. The `Exp` parser matches the exponent part of a floating-point number. The `FloatType` parser matches the type suffix of a floating-point number. The `WSChars` parser matches a sequence of whitespace characters, while the `Newline` parser matches a newline character. The `Semi` parser matches a semicolon or one or more newline characters.\n\nThe `OpChar` parser matches a single operation character, which is any character that can be used as an operator in ErgoScript. The `isOpChar` function defines the set of characters that are allowed as operators in ErgoScript. The `LetterDigitDollarUnderscore` parser matches any character that is allowed in an identifier in ErgoScript. The `Lower` parser matches a lowercase letter, dollar sign, or underscore, while the `Upper` parser matches an uppercase letter.\n\nThe `error` function is used to throw a `ParserException` when a parsing error occurs. The `ParserException` class extends `CompilerException` and is used to represent errors that occur during parsing.\n\nThe `Key` object contains parsers for ErgoScript keywords and key-operators. The `W` parser matches a keyword and ensures that subsequent characters do not match in order for it to be a keyword. The `O` parser matches a key-operator and stops early if it is followed by a comment so that the comment can be parsed separately.\n\nOverall, this code provides the basic building blocks for parsing ErgoScript code and generating an AST. It is an essential part of the larger project and enables the execution of ErgoScript contracts on the Ergo blockchain.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains basic lexical parsers for ErgoScript.\n\n2. What are some examples of characters allowed in identifiers and operations?\n- Identifiers can contain letters, digits, dollar signs, and underscores. Operations can contain various symbols such as exclamation marks, percentages, and mathematical symbols.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the ParserException class?\n- The ParserException class is used to throw an exception when there is an error in parsing the code, with an error message and source context descriptor.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/syntax/Basic.md"}}],["368",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/syntax/Core.scala)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the Sigmastate project and defines a trait called \"Core\". This trait contains a set of keywords and identifiers used in expressions. The purpose of this trait is to provide a set of common aliases and keywords that can be used in almost every parser in the file. \n\nThe trait contains two methods, \"mkUnaryOp\" and \"mkBinaryOp\", which are used to construct ErgoTree unary and binary operations, respectively. These methods take an operation name and one or two values of SType, respectively, and return a value of SType. \n\nThe trait also contains a set of aliases for common things such as keywords and symbols. These aliases are used in almost every parser in the file, so it makes sense to keep them short. For example, the keyword \"type\" is aliased as \"type[_:P]\", and the symbol \"=>\" is aliased as \"`=>`[_:P]\". \n\nThe trait also defines several parsers for identifiers, literals, and other constructs used in expressions. For example, the parser \"Id[_:P]\" parses an identifier, and the parser \"ExprLiteral[_:P]\" parses an expression literal. \n\nOverall, the \"Core\" trait provides a set of common aliases and parsers that can be used throughout the project to simplify the parsing and construction of expressions. Here is an example of how the \"mkUnaryOp\" method might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nval opName = \"NOT\"\nval arg = builder.mkIdent(\"x\", SBoolean)\nval result = mkUnaryOp(opName, arg)\n```\n\nThis code constructs a unary operation with the name \"NOT\" and the argument \"x\" of type SBoolean. The resulting value is of type SBoolean and can be used in further expressions.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Core` trait?\n- The `Core` trait defines keywords and identifiers used in expressions and provides constructors for ErgoTree unary and binary operations.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `PostDotCheck` method?\n- The `PostDotCheck` method is used to whitelist a few suffixes that come after a `.` select. Everything else is considered illegal.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `StableId` method?\n- The `StableId` method defines a parser for stable identifiers, which are used to represent paths to objects and values in the program.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/syntax/Core.md"}}],["369",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/syntax/Exprs.scala)\n\nThis code defines a set of parsers for ErgoScript expressions, which are part of the Ergo blockchain platform. ErgoScript is a language used to write smart contracts on the Ergo platform. The parsers are implemented using the FastParse library and are organized in a trait called `Exprs`, which extends the `Core` and `Types` traits.\n\nThe `Exprs` trait contains several parsers for different types of expressions, such as `BlockDef`, `If`, `Fun`, and `LambdaRhs`. These parsers are used to parse various ErgoScript constructs like variable definitions, if-else expressions, function definitions, and lambda expressions. The trait also provides utility methods like `mkInfixTree`, `applySuffix`, and `block` to build the abstract syntax tree (AST) for the parsed expressions.\n\nThe code also defines a `WsCtx` class, which represents the parsing context for expressions. It has three derived classes: `StatCtx`, `ExprCtx`, and `FreeCtx`. These classes are used to handle different parsing scenarios, such as expressions used as statements, expressions nested within other expressions, and expressions directly within a `val x = ...` or `def x = ...`.\n\nAn example of using these parsers in a larger project would be to parse ErgoScript code and generate an AST, which can then be used for further processing, such as type checking, optimization, or code generation.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Expr` parser can be used:\n\n```scala\nval input = \"if (x > 0) x * 2 else x / 2\"\nval parsedExpr = fastparse.parse(input, Exprs.Expr(_))\n```\n\nThis code snippet would parse the input string containing an ErgoScript expression and return a parsed expression in the form of an AST.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `WsCtx` class and its parameters `semiInference` and `arrowTypeAscriptions`?\n   **Answer**: The `WsCtx` class represents the parsing context of expressions. The `semiInference` parameter determines whether semicolon inference is enabled, and the `arrowTypeAscriptions` parameter determines whether arrow-type ascriptions like `i: a => b` are allowed in the current context.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `mkInfixTree` function handle operator precedence when constructing the expression tree?\n   **Answer**: The `mkInfixTree` function uses a tail-recursive algorithm to build the expression tree while respecting operator precedence. It maintains a stack of waiting operations and iteratively processes the input list of operations, comparing the precedence of the current operation with the next one to decide whether to apply the current operation or push it onto the stack.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `priorityList` and `priorityMap` variables in the code?\n   **Answer**: The `priorityList` variable defines the precedence levels of infix operators based on their first character, with characters on the same line having the same precedence. The `priorityMap` variable is a derived map that associates each operator character with its precedence level, making it easier to look up the precedence of a given operator during expression tree construction.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/syntax/Exprs.md"}}],["370",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/syntax/Identifiers.scala)\n\nThe `Identifiers` object in the `sigmastate.lang.syntax` package provides functionality for parsing and identifying identifiers and keywords in the Sigma programming language. \n\nThe `Identifiers` object defines several parsers for different types of identifiers. The `VarId` parser matches variable names, which must start with a lowercase letter and can contain letters, digits, and underscores. The `UppercaseId` parser matches type names, which must start with an uppercase letter and can contain letters, digits, and underscores. The `PlainId` parser matches any identifier that is not enclosed in backticks, including variable names, type names, and operators. The `PlainIdNoDollar` parser matches the same identifiers as `PlainId`, but does not allow dollar signs in variable names. The `BacktickId` parser matches any identifier enclosed in backticks, allowing it to contain any characters except backticks.\n\nThe `Identifiers` object also defines parsers for operators and keywords. The `Operator` parser matches any operator symbol that is not a keyword, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators. The `Keywords` parser matches any keyword in the Sigma language, including `case`, `else`, `false`, `function`, `if`, `match`, `return`, `then`, and `true`. \n\nOverall, the `Identifiers` object is an important part of the Sigma language parser, allowing it to identify and parse different types of identifiers and keywords. It can be used in conjunction with other parsers in the `sigmastate.lang.syntax` package to parse Sigma code and generate an abstract syntax tree. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nimport fastparse._\nimport sigmastate.lang.syntax.Identifiers._\n\nval result = parse(\"x + y\", PlainId(_))\n// result: Parsed.Success[Unit] = Success((), 5)\n\nval result2 = parse(\"if (x > y) then x else y\", Keywords(_))\n// result2: Parsed.Failure = Failure(\"if (x > y) then x else y\", 0)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Identifiers` object?\n- The `Identifiers` object defines parsers for identifiers and keywords in the syntax of a programming language.\n\n2.

The trait defines a set of methods that parse different types of literals, including integers, booleans, strings, and null values. The trait also defines a set of methods that parse different types of whitespace, including newlines, semicolons, and comments.\n\nThe trait is designed to be mixed in with other traits and classes that define parsers for different parts of the Sigma language. The `builder` field is an instance of the `SigmaBuilder` trait, which is used by the parsers to create ErgoTree expressions.

The trait extends another trait called `ContractSyntax` which is not shown in this code snippet. \n\nThe first method, `transferErgWithChange`, takes in a `TransactionCandidate` object, an `OutBox` object representing the source of the Ergs, a `PropositionSpec` object representing the destination of the Ergs, and a `Long` value representing the amount of Ergs to transfer. The method returns a tuple containing an `OutBox` object representing the destination box and an optional `OutBox` object representing the change box. \n\nThe method first calculates the amount of Erg change that will be returned to the source box after the transfer. If the change is negative, an error is thrown indicating that there are not enough Ergs in the source box to complete the transfer. If the change is positive, a new `OutBox` object is created to represent the change box. \n\nThe destination box is then created using the `outBox` method of the `TransactionCandidate` object with the specified Erg amount and destination `PropositionSpec`. The method returns the destination box and the change box (if it exists). \n\nThe second method, `transferTokenWithChange`, is similar to the first method but also includes the transfer of a specified token amount. The method takes in a `Token` object representing the token to transfer in addition to the other parameters. \n\nThe method first calculates the amount of token change that will be returned to the source box after the transfer. If the change is negative, an error is thrown indicating that there are not enough tokens in the source box to complete the transfer. The method then calculates the amount of Erg change that will be returned to the source box after the transfer. If the Erg change is less than the minimum Erg value, an error is thrown indicating that there are not enough Ergs in the source box to create two boxes. \n\nThe destination box is then created using the `outBox` method of the `TransactionCandidate` object with the minimum Erg value and destination `PropositionSpec`. The token amount is added to the destination box using the `withTokens` method. If there is Erg change, a new `OutBox` object is created to represent the change box. The method returns the destination box and the change box (if it exists). \n\nThese methods can be used in the larger project to facilitate the transfer of Ergs and tokens between boxes in a transaction. The methods provide a convenient way to calculate the change that will be returned to the source box after the transfer. Developers can use these methods to simplify the process of creating transactions that involve the transfer of assets. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval tx = new TransactionCandidate()\nval fromBox = new OutBox(...)\nval toSpec = new PropositionSpec(...)\nval ergAmt = 1000000L\nval tokenAmt = new Token(...)\nval (destBox, changeBox) = transferTokenWithChange(tx, fromBox, toSpec, tokenAmt)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

It defines several traits and objects, such as `PropositionSpec`, `ProvingParty`, `VerifyingParty`, `InputBox`, `OutBox`, `TransactionCandidate`, `ChainTransaction`, and `ChainBlock`. These traits and objects represent various components of a smart contract and provide methods for specifying, proving, verifying, and interacting with input and output boxes in transactions.\n\n`ContractSyntax.scala` extends the `SigmaContract` and provides methods and classes for contract implementations. It defines the `ContractSyntax` trait, which offers methods for creating propositions and environments. The `SigmaContractSyntax` trait extends `ContractSyntax` and provides additional methods for defining contracts using logical AND and OR operations between Boolean and SigmaProp values.\n\n`ErgoContractSpec.scala` extends the `ContractSpec` trait and provides methods and traits for defining and interacting with Ergo contracts. It defines the `ErgoOutBox` case class, which represents an output box in an Ergo transaction, and the `TransactionContext` trait, which provides methods for interacting with Ergo transactions. Additionally, it offers utility methods for interacting with the Ergo blockchain, such as `getBlock`, `getBoxesByParty`, and `getBoxById`.\n\n`StdContracts.scala` defines the `StdContracts` trait, which provides methods for transferring assets (Ergs and tokens) in a transaction. The methods `transferErgWithChange` and `transferTokenWithChange` facilitate the transfer of Ergs and tokens between boxes in a transaction while calculating the change returned to the source box.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval tx = new TransactionCandidate()\nval fromBox = new OutBox(...)\nval toSpec = new PropositionSpec(...)\nval ergAmt = 1000000L\nval tokenAmt = new Token(...)\nval (destBox, changeBox) = transferTokenWithChange(tx, fromBox, toSpec, tokenAmt)\n```\n\nIn summary, this folder contains code for defining and interacting with smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain platform.

ErgoTree is a data structure used in the Ergo blockchain platform to represent smart contracts. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to convert ErgoTree objects to and from bytes and hexadecimal strings.\n\nThe `ErgoTree` class is defined as a Scala.js object that takes an `ErgoTree` object as a parameter. It has two methods: `toBytes()` and `toHex()`. The `toBytes()` method serializes the `ErgoTree` object using the `ErgoTreeSerializer` and returns the resulting byte array. The `toHex()` method encodes the byte array returned by `toBytes()` into a hexadecimal string using the `Base16` encoding scheme.\n\nThe `ErgoTrees` object is defined as a Scala.js object that provides two methods: `fromHex()` and `fromBytes()`. The `fromHex()` method takes a hexadecimal string as a parameter, decodes it using the `Base16` encoding scheme, and returns an `ErgoTree` object by calling the `fromBytes()` method. The `fromBytes()` method takes a byte array as a parameter, deserializes it using the `ErgoTreeSerializer`, and returns a new `ErgoTree` object.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to facilitate the serialization and deserialization of ErgoTree objects. For example, if the project involves creating and executing smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain platform, this code can be used to convert the smart contract code into an `ErgoTree` object, which can then be stored on the blockchain. Later, when the smart contract needs to be executed, the `ErgoTree` object can be retrieved from the blockchain and deserialized back into the original smart contract code using the `fromBytes()` method. Overall, this code provides a convenient way to work with ErgoTree objects in a Scala.js environment.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The keyLength parameter specifies the length of the keys in the tree, while valueLengthOpt is an optional parameter that specifies the length of the values associated with the keys. This class is exported as a top-level object, meaning it can be accessed from other parts of the project.\n\nThe Header class represents a block header in the Ergo blockchain. It takes in several parameters, including the block's ID, version, and parent ID, as well as various other pieces of information such as the root of the authenticated data structure (ADProofsRoot), the root of the state tree (represented by an instance of the AvlTree class), and the root of the transaction tree. The class also includes information about the block's timestamp, difficulty (nBits), height, and various cryptographic keys and nonces.

The `Prover` class takes an instance of the `sdk.Prover` class as a parameter and exposes two methods: `reduce` and `reduceTransaction`.\n\nThe `reduce` method takes four parameters: `stateCtx`, `unsignedTx`, `boxesToSpend`, and `baseCost`. `stateCtx` is an instance of the `BlockchainStateContext` class, `unsignedTx` is an instance of the `transactionsMod.UnsignedTransaction` class, `boxesToSpend` is an array of `inputsMod.EIP12UnsignedInput` instances, and `baseCost` is an integer. The method first creates an instance of the `sdk.UnreducedTransaction` class using the `unsignedTx`, `boxesToSpend`, and empty `dataInputs` and `tokensToBurn` arrays. It then calls the `reduce` method of the `_prover` instance with the `stateCtx`, `tx`, and `baseCost` parameters. Finally, it returns a new instance of the `ReducedTransaction` class.\n\nThe `reduceTransaction` method takes six parameters: `unsignedTx`, `boxesToSpend`, `dataBoxes`, `stateDigest`, `baseCost`, and `tokensToBurn`. `unsignedTx` and `boxesToSpend` are the same as in the `reduce` method. `dataBoxes` is an array of `Box[commonMod.Amount]` instances, `stateDigest` is a string, and `tokensToBurn` is an array of `tokenMod.TokenAmount[commonMod.Amount]` instances. The method creates an instance of the `sdk.UnreducedTransaction` class using the `unsignedTx`, `boxesToSpend`, `dataBoxes`, and `tokensToBurn` parameters. It then returns a tuple containing a new instance of the `ReducedTransaction` class and an integer value of 0.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to reduce transactions in the Ergo blockchain using an instance of the `sdk.Prover` class. The `reduce` and `reduceTransaction` methods take different sets of parameters and can be used in different contexts depending on the needs of the larger project. For example, the `reduce` method may be used to reduce a transaction before it is broadcast to the network, while the `reduceTransaction` method may be used to reduce a transaction that has already been broadcast and is waiting to be included in a block.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Prover` class and its methods?\n- The `Prover` class is a wrapper around the `sdk.Prover` class and provides two methods for reducing transactions. The `reduce` method takes in a `BlockchainStateContext`, an `UnsignedTransaction`, an array of `EIP12UnsignedInput` boxes to spend, and a base cost, and returns a `ReducedTransaction`. The `reduceTransaction` method takes in similar parameters as `reduce`, as well as an array of data boxes and an array of tokens to burn, and returns a tuple of a `ReducedTransaction` and an integer.\n \n2. What is the purpose of the `ReducedTransaction` class?\n- The `ReducedTransaction` class is a placeholder class that does not have any functionality or properties. It is used as a return type for the `reduce` and `reduceTransaction` methods in the `Prover` class.\n\n3. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has external dependencies on the `org.ergoplatform.sdk` package, the `typings.fleetSdkCommon` package (specifically the `boxesMod`, `commonMod`, `inputsMod`, `tokenMod`, and `transactionsMod` modules), and the `scala.scalajs.js` package.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/sdk/js/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/js/Prover.md"}}],["408",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/sdk/js/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/js/ProverBuilder.scala)\n\nThe code above defines a class called `ProverBuilder` that is used to build a prover object for the Ergo blockchain platform. The `ProverBuilder` class takes two arguments: `parameters` of type `ErgoLikeParameters` and `networkPrefix` of type `NetworkPrefix`. The `ErgoLikeParameters` class is used to define the parameters of an Ergo transaction, while the `NetworkPrefix` class is used to specify the network prefix of the Ergo blockchain (either `Mainnet` or `Testnet`).\n\nThe `ProverBuilder` class has several methods that can be used to configure the prover object. The `withMnemonic` method takes two arguments: `mnemonicPhrase` and `mnemonicPass`, both of type `String`. These arguments are used to generate a secret key for the prover object. The `withEip3Secret` method takes an integer argument `index` and is used to add an EIP3 secret to the prover object. The `withDHTData` method takes five arguments: `g`, `h`, `u`, `v`, and `x`, where `g`, `h`, `u`, and `v` are group elements and `x` is a big integer. This method is used to add DHT data to the prover object. Finally, the `withDLogSecret` method takes a big integer argument `x` and is used to add a DLog secret to the prover object.\n\nOnce the prover object has been configured using the `ProverBuilder` class, the `build` method can be called to create a new `Prover` object. The `Prover` class is not defined in this file, but it is likely defined elsewhere in the project.\n\nThis code is likely used in a larger project that involves building and signing Ergo transactions. The `ProverBuilder` class provides a convenient way to configure a prover object with the necessary secrets and data to sign a transaction. The resulting `Prover` object can then be used to sign a transaction and submit it to the Ergo blockchain. An example usage of this code might look like:\n\n```\nval parameters = new ErgoLikeParameters(...)\nval networkPrefix = NetworkPrefix.Testnet\nval builder = new ProverBuilder(parameters, networkPrefix)\nbuilder.withMnemonic(\"my secret phrase\", \"my password\")\nbuilder.withDLogSecret(1234567890)\nval prover = builder.build()\nval signedTx = prover.sign(tx)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   - This code defines a class called `ProverBuilder` in the `org.ergoplatform.sdk.js` package that provides methods for building a prover object for the Ergo blockchain platform. It uses various dependencies and libraries to construct the prover object with different types of secret keys and data.\n\n2. What are the parameters required to instantiate an object of the `ProverBuilder` class?\n   - An object of the `ProverBuilder` class requires two parameters: an `ErgoLikeParameters` object and a `NetworkPrefix` object. These parameters are used to initialize the `_builder` object of the `sdk.ProverBuilder` class, which is used to construct the prover object.\n\n3. What are some of the methods available in the `ProverBuilder` class and what do they do?\n   - The `ProverBuilder` class provides several methods for adding different types of secret keys and data to the prover object, such as `withMnemonic`, `withEip3Secret`, `withDHTData`, and `withDLogSecret`. These methods take different parameters and use various functions to convert data types and formats to the required format for the prover object. The `build` method is used to construct the final `Prover` object from the `_builder` object.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/sdk/js/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/js/ProverBuilder.md"}}],["409",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/sdk/js/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/js/Type.scala)\n\nThe code above defines a set of classes and methods that represent ErgoScript types in a JavaScript-friendly way. The `Type` class is a wrapper around the `RType` type descriptor, which is used to represent types in the ErgoScript language. The `Type` class has a single field, `rtype`, which is the underlying `RType` descriptor. \n\nThe `Type` class has a method called `name`, which returns the syntactically correct type name as a string. There is also an overridden `toString` method that returns a string representation of the `Type` object.\n\nThe `Types` object defines a set of static fields and methods that represent common ErgoScript types. These include `Byte`, `Short`, `Int`, and `Long`, which are descriptors for the corresponding primitive types in ErgoScript. There are also two methods, `pairType` and `collType`, which construct descriptors for pair and collection types, respectively.\n\nThe `pairType` method takes two `Type` objects as arguments and returns a new `Type` object that represents a pair of those types. The `collType` method takes a single `Type` object as an argument and returns a new `Type` object that represents a collection of elements of that type.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to represent ErgoScript types in a JavaScript-friendly way, which can be useful when working with ErgoScript in a JavaScript environment. The `Types` object provides a set of common type descriptors that can be used to construct more complex types. For example, to represent a collection of pairs of integers, one could use the following code:\n\n```\nval pairType = Type.pairType(Type.Int, Type.Int)\nval collType = Type.collType(pairType)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `Value` class is used to represent any valid value of the ErgoScript language. Each `Value` instance comes equipped with a `Type` descriptor. The `Value` class is implemented based on the pre-defined mapping between JavaScript and ErgoScript types. This mapping is applied recursively and is given by the following:\n\n| JS type | ErgoScript Type |\n| -------| ---------------|\n| Number | Byte |\n| Number | Short |\n| Number | Int |\n| BigInt | Long |\n| BigInt | BigInt |\n| array [A, B] | (A, B) - pair |\n| array [a1, a2 ..] | Coll[A] - collection |\n\nThe `Value` class has two properties: `data` and `tpe`. The `data` property is the JavaScript value wrapped in this `Value` instance. The `tpe` property is the type descriptor of the ErgoScript type. \n\nThe `Value` class has two methods: `runtimeData` and `toHex()`. The `runtimeData` method returns the Sigma runtime value which can be passed to the interpreter, saved in the register, and `sigmastate.Values.Constant` nodes. The `toHex()` method encodes this `Value` instance as a Base16 hex string. \n\nThe `Values` object contains helper methods to create `Value` instances from JavaScript values. The `ofByte()`, `ofShort()`, `ofInt()`, and `ofLong()` methods create `Value` instances from JavaScript numbers. The `pairOf()` method creates a `Value` instance from two `Value` instances. The `collOf()` method creates a `Value` instance from an array of elements and an element type descriptor. The `fromHex()` method creates a `Value` instance from a hex-encoded serialized bytes of `Constant` values. \n\nOverall, the `Value` class and `Values` object are essential components of the ErgoScript language implementation in JavaScript. They allow for the representation of ErgoScript values in JavaScript and provide methods to encode and decode these values.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Value` class and how is it used in ErgoScript language?\n- The `Value` class is used to represent any valid value of ErgoScript language and comes equipped with a `Type` descriptor. It is used to create Sigma runtime values which can be passed to interpreter, saved in register and `Constant` nodes.\n2. What is the mapping between JS types and ErgoScript types?\n- The mapping between JS types and ErgoScript types is as follows:\n  - Number -> Byte, Short, Int\n  - BigInt -> Long, BigInt\n  - array [A, B] -> (A, B) - pair\n  - array [a1, a2 ..] -> Coll[A] - collection\n3. How is a `Value` encoded as a Base16 hex string?\n- A `Value` is encoded as a Base16 hex string by transforming it into a `ConstantNode` of Sigma, serializing the constant into a byte array using `ConstantSerializer`, and then encoding the bytes using Base16 encoder into a string.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/sdk/js/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/js/Value.md"}}],["411",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/.autodoc/docs/json/sdk/js/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/js)\n\nThe `.autodoc/docs/json/sdk/js/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/js` folder contains Scala.js implementations for various Ergo blockchain platform components, such as transaction processing, block headers, and ErgoScript types.

It is used to generate proofs for transactions. It takes in `secretKeys`, `dLogInputs`, `dhtInputs`, and `params` as parameters. `secretKeys` are secrets in extended form to be used by the prover. `dLogInputs` are prover inputs containing secrets for generating proofs for ProveDlog nodes. `dhtInputs` are prover inputs containing secrets for generating proofs for ProveDHTuple nodes. `params` are ergo blockchain parameters.\n\nThe class extends `ReducingInterpreter` and `ProverInterpreter`. It has a `secrets` field that holds all the necessary secrets to satisfy the given sigma proposition in the reducedInput. It has a `pubKeys` field that holds all public keys that correspond to all the DLogProverInput known to this prover.\n\nThe `sign` method reduces and signs the given transaction. It takes in `unreducedTx`, `stateContext`, and `baseCost` as parameters. `unreducedTx` is the unreduced transaction data to be reduced (contains unsigned transaction). `stateContext` is the state context of the blockchain in which the transaction should be signed. `baseCost` is the cost accumulated before this transaction. It returns a new signed transaction with all inputs signed and the cost of this transaction. The returned cost doesn't include `baseCost`.\n\nThe `signReduced` method signs the given transaction (i.e. providing spending proofs) for each input so that the resulting transaction can be submitted to the blockchain. It takes in `reducedTx` as a parameter. `reducedTx` is an unsigned transaction augmented with reduced. It returns a new signed transaction with all inputs signed and the cost of this transaction. The returned cost includes the costs of obtaining reduced transaction and the cost of verification of each signed input.\n\nThe `proveReduced` method generates proof (aka signature) for the given message using secrets of this prover. All the necessary secrets should be configured in this prover to satisfy the given sigma proposition in the reducedInput.\n\n## ReducedErgoLikeTransaction Class\n\nThe `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` class represents `reduced` transaction, i.e. unsigned transaction where each unsigned input is augmented with `ReducedInputData` which contains a script reduction result. After an unsigned transaction is reduced it can be signed without context. Thus, it can be serialized and transferred for example to Cold Wallet and signed in an environment where secrets are known. It takes in `unsignedTx` and `reducedInputs` as parameters. `unsignedTx` is an unsigned transaction. `reducedInputs` is a sequence of `ReducedInputData`.\n\n## ReducedInputData Class\n\nThe `ReducedInputData` class represents data necessary to sign an input of an unsigned transaction. It takes in `reductionResult` and `extension` as parameters. `reductionResult` is the result of reducing input script to a sigma proposition. `extension` is context extensions (aka context variables) used by script and which are also necessary to verify the transaction on-chain. Extensions are included in tx bytes, which are signed.\n\n## TokenBalanceException Class\n\nThe `TokenBalanceException` class is thrown during transaction signing when inputs token are not balanced with output tokens. It takes in `message` and `tokensDiff` as parameters. `message` is the balance difference which caused the error. `tokensDiff` is the difference between input and output tokens.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `AppkitProvingInterpreter` class?\n- The `AppkitProvingInterpreter` class holds secrets and can sign transactions to generate proofs. It takes in secrets, prover inputs, and blockchain parameters as parameters.\n\n2. What is the difference between `sign` and `signReduced` methods in the `AppkitProvingInterpreter` class?\n- The `sign` method reduces and signs the given transaction, while the `signReduced` method signs the given transaction without requiring context to generate proofs.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ReducedErgoLikeTransactionSerializer` object?\n- The `ReducedErgoLikeTransactionSerializer` object is used to serialize and parse `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` objects, which are unsigned transactions augmented with `ReducedInputData` that contain a script reduction result.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/AppkitProvingInterpreter.md"}}],["420",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/DataJsonEncoder.scala)\n\nThe `DataJsonEncoder` object in this code is responsible for encoding and decoding data in JSON format for the Ergo platform SDK. It provides methods to convert data between JSON and Ergo platform's internal data types, such as `SInt`, `SLong`, `SBigInt`, `SString`, `SCollectionType`, `SOption`, `STuple`, `SGroupElement`, `SAvlTree`, `SSigmaProp`, and `SBox`. This is useful for serializing and deserializing data when communicating with external systems or storing data in a human-readable format.\n\nThe main methods provided by this object are:\n\n- `encode[T <: SType](v: T#WrappedType, tpe: T): Json`: Encodes a value `v` of type `T` into a JSON object, including the type information.\n- `encodeAnyValue(v: AnyValue): Json`: Encodes an `AnyValue` into a JSON object, including the type information.\n- `decode(json: Json): SType#WrappedType`: Decodes a JSON object into a value of the corresponding `SType`.\n- `decodeAnyValue(json: Json): AnyValue`: Decodes a JSON object into an `AnyValue`.\n\nThese methods rely on several private helper methods for encoding and decoding specific data types, such as `encodeBytes`, `decodeBytes`, `encodeData`, `decodeData`, `decodeColl`, and `decodeWithTpe`.\n\nFor example, to encode an `SInt` value into JSON:\n\n```scala\nval intValue: SInt#WrappedType = 42\nval json: Json = DataJsonEncoder.encode(intValue, SInt)\n```\n\nAnd to decode the JSON back into an `SInt` value:\n\n```scala\nval decodedValue: SInt#WrappedType = DataJsonEncoder.decode(json).asInstanceOf[SInt#WrappedType]\n```\n\nThis object is useful in the larger project for handling data serialization and deserialization between the Ergo platform and external systems, such as APIs, databases, or user interfaces.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `DataJsonEncoder` object and its methods?\n   **Answer**: The `DataJsonEncoder` object is responsible for encoding and decoding data of various types to and from JSON format. It provides methods like `encode`, `encodeAnyValue`, `decode`, and `decodeAnyValue` to handle the conversion between data types and JSON.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `encodeData` method work and what types does it support?\n   **Answer**: The `encodeData` method takes a value `v` and its type `tpe` as input and returns a JSON representation of the value.

The ErgoId class contains a byte array that usually represents a 256-bit hash. The class provides methods to create an ErgoId object from a base16 string and to extract the underlying byte array.\n\nThe ErgoId class also overrides the hashCode and equals methods to support equality. The hashCode method converts the byte array to an integer using the Ints.fromByteArray method from the scorex.utils package. If the byte array is null or less than 4 bytes, the method uses the util.Arrays.hashCode method instead. The equals method checks if the object being compared is null, if it is the same object, or if it is an instance of ErgoId. If it is an ErgoId object, the method checks if the byte arrays are equal using the util.Arrays.equals method.\n\nFinally, the ErgoId class provides a toString method that returns a string representation of the byte array using Base16 encoding.\n\nThe ErgoId object can be used to uniquely identify an Ergo object in the larger project. For example, it can be used to identify a transaction or a box in the Ergo blockchain. The ErgoId object can be created using the create method of the ErgoId object, which takes a base16 string as input. The resulting ErgoId object can then be used to compare with other ErgoId objects to check for equality. The toString method can also be used to obtain a string representation of the ErgoId object for display purposes.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval id1 = ErgoId.create(\"0123456789abcdef\")\nval id2 = ErgoId.create(\"0123456789abcdef\")\nval id3 = ErgoId.create(\"fedcba9876543210\")\n\nprintln(id1 == id2) // true\nprintln(id1 == id3) // false\n\nprintln(id1.toString) // \"0123456789abcdef\"\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What hashing algorithm is used in the ErgoId class?\n   - The ErgoId class uses the Ints.fromByteArray method to hash the byte array if it is at least 4 bytes long, otherwise it uses the util.Arrays.hashCode method. The specific hashing algorithm used by Ints.fromByteArray is not specified in this code.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/ErgoId.md"}}],["422",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/ErgoToken.scala)\n\nThe code above defines a case class called ErgoToken that represents an Ergo token (also known as an asset) paired with its value. The class has two parameters: id, which is an instance of ErgoId, and value, which is a Long. ErgoId is a separate class that is not defined in this file.\n\nThe ErgoToken class has three constructors. The first constructor takes an ErgoId instance and a Long value as parameters. The second constructor takes an array of bytes and a Long value as parameters, and it creates a new ErgoId instance from the array of bytes. The third constructor takes a String and a Long value as parameters, and it decodes the String into an array of bytes using a helper method called JavaHelpers.decodeStringToBytes().\n\nThe class also has two methods: getId() and getValue(). getId() returns the ErgoId instance associated with the ErgoToken, while getValue() returns the Long value associated with the ErgoToken.\n\nThis class is useful in the larger project because it allows Ergo tokens to be represented as objects that can be used as keys in maps and sets. This makes it easier to manipulate and store Ergo tokens in the project. For example, if the project needs to keep track of a user's Ergo token balance, it can use a map where the keys are ErgoToken instances and the values are Longs representing the token balances. Here is an example of how this might look:\n\n```\nval tokenBalanceMap: Map[ErgoToken, Long] = Map(\n  ErgoToken(\"token1\", 100) -> 500L,\n  ErgoToken(\"token2\", 200) -> 1000L,\n  ErgoToken(\"token3\", 300) -> 750L\n)\n\nval userTokenBalance: Long = tokenBalanceMap(ErgoToken(\"token2\", 200))\n// userTokenBalance is now 1000L\n```\n\nIn this example, the tokenBalanceMap is a Map where the keys are ErgoToken instances and the values are Longs representing the token balances. The userTokenBalance variable is set to the value associated with the ErgoToken instance representing \"token2\" with a value of 200. This allows the project to easily keep track of Ergo token balances for different users.\n## Questions: \n 1.

An ErgoBox is a data structure that contains a certain amount of cryptocurrency and can be used as an input or output in a transaction on the Ergo blockchain. Context variables, also known as ContextExtensions, are additional data that is required to satisfy the guarding proposition of the box. The guarding proposition is a script that must be evaluated to true in order for the box to be spent in a transaction.\n\nThe ExtendedInputBox class takes two parameters: an instance of ErgoBox and a set of context variables. These parameters are used to create an ExtendedInputBox object, which can then be used as an input in a transaction. The toUnsignedInput method is provided to convert an ExtendedInputBox object into an UnsignedInput object, which is used to create a signed transaction.\n\nThis code is part of the Ergo Platform SDK, which is a set of tools and libraries for building applications on the Ergo blockchain. The ExtendedInputBox class is a useful abstraction for working with input boxes in transactions, as it encapsulates both the box and its required context variables. This can simplify the process of constructing and signing transactions, as the necessary data is contained within a single object. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimport org.ergoplatform.sdk.ExtendedInputBox\nimport org.ergoplatform.{ErgoBox, UnsignedInput}\nimport sigmastate.interpreter.ContextExtension\n\n// create an ErgoBox and a ContextExtension\nval box = new ErgoBox(1000000, Array[Byte](1, 2, 3))\nval extension = new ContextExtension(Map(\"key\" -> Array[Byte](4, 5, 6)))\n\n// create an ExtendedInputBox object\nval inputBox = ExtendedInputBox(box, extension)\n\n// convert to UnsignedInput\nval unsignedInput = inputBox.toUnsignedInput\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

These classes are designed to simplify common operations and improve code readability.\n\nThe `GenIterableOps` class provides a `mapReduce` method that applies a map function to each element of a collection, groups the results by key, and reduces each group using a reduce function. The resulting collection is a new collection of (K,V) pairs, where K is the key and V is the reduced value. This method is useful for performing complex operations on collections, such as aggregating data or calculating statistics.\n\nThe `CollOps` class provides several methods for working with Ergo's `Coll` data structure. These methods include `partition`, which partitions a collection into two collections based on a predicate; `toMap`, which converts a collection of (K,V) pairs to an immutable map; `sum`, which sums the elements of a collection using a `Numeric` type; `mapReduce`, which applies a map function to each element of a collection, groups the results by key, and reduces each group using a reduce function; and `groupBy` and `groupByProjecting`, which partition a collection into a map of collections based on a discriminator function.\n\nThe `PairCollOps` class provides additional methods for working with Ergo's `PairColl` data structure. These methods include `mapFirst` and `mapSecond`, which map the first and second components of each pair in the collection, respectively; `reduceByKey`, which uses the first component of each pair in the collection as a key for grouping and reducing the corresponding values; `sumByKey`, which uses the first component of each pair in the collection as a key for grouping and summing the corresponding values using a `Numeric` type; and `groupByKey`, which uses the first component of each pair in the collection as a key for grouping the corresponding values into a new collection.\n\nThe `CollBuilderOps` class provides additional methods for working with Ergo's `CollBuilder` data structure. These methods include `outerJoin`, which performs an outer join operation between two collections and returns a collection of (K,O) pairs, where each key comes from either the left or right collection and values are produced by projections; and `fromMap`, which constructs a collection of (K,V) pairs using a `PairColl` representation, in which keys and values are stored as separate unboxed arrays.\n\nOverall, these implicit classes provide a wide range of functionality for working with collections in Ergo and can greatly simplify complex operations.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It also provides utility methods for handling errors and converting between different data representations (e.g., `fromTry`, `fromOption`, `fromThrows`).\n\nHere's an example of how an encoder and decoder are defined for the `ErgoBox` data type:\n\n```scala\nimplicit val ergoBoxEncoder: Encoder[ErgoBox] = Encoder.instance({ box =>\n  Json.obj(\n    \"boxId\" -> box.id.asJson,\n    \"value\" -> box.value.asJson,\n    \"ergoTree\" -> ErgoTreeSerializer.DefaultSerializer.serializeErgoTree(box.ergoTree).asJson,\n    \"assets\" -> box.additionalTokens.toArray.toSeq.asJson,\n    \"creationHeight\" -> box.creationHeight.asJson,\n    \"additionalRegisters\" -> box.additionalRegisters.asJson,\n    \"transactionId\" -> box.transactionId.asJson,\n    \"index\" -> box.index.asJson\n  )\n})\n\nimplicit val ergoBoxDecoder: Decoder[ErgoBox] = Decoder.instance({ cursor =>\n  for {\n    value <- cursor.downField(\"value\").as[Long]\n    ergoTreeBytes <- cursor.downField(\"ergoTree\").as[Array[Byte]]\n    additionalTokens <- cursor.downField(\"assets\").as[Seq[(ErgoBox.TokenId, Long)]]\n    creationHeight <- cursor.downField(\"creationHeight\").as[Int]\n    additionalRegisters <- cursor.downField(\"additionalRegisters\").as[Map[NonMandatoryRegisterId, EvaluatedValue[SType]]]\n    transactionId <- cursor.downField(\"transactionId\").as[ModifierId]\n    index <- cursor.downField(\"index\").as[Short]\n  } yield new ErgoBox(\n    value = value,\n    ergoTree = ErgoTreeSerializer.DefaultSerializer.deserializeErgoTree(ergoTreeBytes),\n    additionalTokens = additionalTokens.toColl,\n    additionalRegisters = additionalRegisters,\n    transactionId = transactionId,\n    index = index,\n    creationHeight = creationHeight\n  )\n})\n```\n\nThese encoders and decoders can be used in the larger project to serialize and deserialize data when communicating with external systems, storing data, or processing data within the Ergo platform.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `JsonCodecs` trait and how is it used in the project?\n   **Answer**: The `JsonCodecs` trait provides implicit JSON encoders and decoders for various data types used in the project. It is used to convert these data types to and from JSON format, which can be useful for communication between different components or for storing data in a human-readable format.\n\n2. **Question**: How are custom encoders and decoders defined for complex data types like `ErgoBox`, `ErgoLikeTransaction`, and `ErgoLikeContext`?\n   **Answer**: Custom encoders and decoders for complex data types are defined using the `Encoder.instance` and `Decoder.instance` methods, respectively. These methods take a function that describes how to convert the data type to or from a JSON representation. For example, the `ErgoBox` encoder is defined as `Encoder.instance({ box => ... })`, where the function inside the instance method describes how to convert an `ErgoBox` object to a JSON object.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `fromTry`, `fromOption`, and `fromThrows` methods, and how are they used in the code?\n   **Answer**: The `fromTry`, `fromOption`, and `fromThrows` methods are utility functions that help in handling errors while decoding JSON data. They convert a `Try`, `Option`, or a block that may throw an exception, respectively, into an `Either[DecodingFailure, T]`. This allows for a more consistent error handling approach when decoding JSON data, as any errors encountered can be represented as a `DecodingFailure` and handled accordingly. These methods are used throughout the code in various custom decoders.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/JsonCodecs.md"}}],["427",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/Prover.scala)\n\nThe code defines a class called `Prover` that provides methods for signing transactions and messages using the Ergo blockchain platform. The class takes two parameters: `_prover`, which is an instance of `AppkitProvingInterpreter`, and `networkPrefix`, which is an instance of `ErgoAddressEncoder.NetworkPrefix`. \n\nThe `Prover` class has several methods that allow for the creation of various types of addresses and the signing of transactions and messages. The `getP2PKAddress` method returns a `P2PKAddress` object, which is a pay-to-public-key address that can be used to receive funds. The `getSecretKey` method returns the private key associated with the `P2PKAddress` object. The `getEip3Addresses` method returns a sequence of `P2PKAddress` objects that can be used to receive funds.\n\nThe `sign` method is used to sign a transaction. It takes an `ErgoLikeStateContext` object, which represents the current state of the blockchain, and an `UnreducedTransaction` object, which is the transaction to be signed. The method returns a `SignedTransaction` object, which is the signed version of the transaction. The `sign` method can also take an optional `baseCost` parameter, which is used to specify the minimum cost of executing the transaction.\n\nThe `signMessage` method is used to sign a message. It takes a `SigmaProp` object, which is a cryptographic primitive used in the Ergo platform, a byte array representing the message to be signed, and a `HintsBag` object, which is used to provide additional information about the signing process. The method returns a byte array representing the signature of the message.\n\nThe `reduce` method is used to reduce an `UnreducedTransaction` object to a `ReducedTransaction` object. The reduction process removes unnecessary data from the transaction, making it smaller and easier to process. The method takes an `ErgoLikeStateContext` object, an `UnreducedTransaction` object, and a `baseCost` parameter, which is used to specify the minimum cost of executing the transaction. The method returns a `ReducedTransaction` object.\n\nThe `signReduced` method is used to sign a `ReducedTransaction` object. It takes a `ReducedTransaction` object and returns a `SignedTransaction` object.\n\nOverall, the `Prover` class provides a set of methods that can be used to sign transactions and messages on the Ergo blockchain platform. These methods can be used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Ergo SDK to build applications that interact with the blockchain.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `ProverBuilder` class provides methods to add various types of secrets to the prover, such as mnemonic phrases, Diffie-Hellman tuples, and discrete logarithms.\n\nThe `ProverBuilder` constructor takes two arguments: `parameters` of type `ErgoLikeParameters` and `networkPrefix` of type `NetworkPrefix`. The `ErgoLikeParameters` object contains various parameters that define the context in which the prover will operate, such as the block height, the minimum box value, and the cost of executing scripts. The `NetworkPrefix` object specifies the network prefix of the Ergo blockchain, which is used to encode and decode Ergo addresses.\n\nThe `ProverBuilder` class has several methods that can be used to add secrets to the prover. The `withMnemonic` method takes a `mnemonicPhrase` and a `mnemonicPass` of type `SecretString` and a `usePre1627KeyDerivation` of type `Boolean`. The `mnemonicPhrase` is a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase that can be used to generate a master key for the prover. The `mnemonicPass` is an optional passphrase that can be used to further secure the mnemonic phrase. The `usePre1627KeyDerivation` flag specifies whether to use the pre-1627 key derivation scheme or the post-1627 key derivation scheme. The method returns the `ProverBuilder` object to allow for method chaining.\n\nThe `withEip3Secret` method takes an `index` of type `Int` and generates a secret key using the EIP-3 key derivation scheme. The method requires that a master key has already been added using the `withMnemonic` method. The generated secret key is paired with its derivation path index and added to the `_eip2Keys` array buffer. The method returns the `ProverBuilder` object to allow for method chaining.\n\nThe `withDHTData` method takes a `g`, `h`, `u`, `v`, and `x` of types `GroupElement` and `BigInteger`. These parameters are used to create a Diffie-Hellman tuple prover input using the `JavaHelpers.createDiffieHellmanTupleProverInput` method. The resulting prover input is added to the `_dhtSecrets` array buffer. The method throws an exception if the same prover input has already been added. The method returns the `ProverBuilder` object to allow for method chaining.\n\nThe `withDLogSecret` method takes an `x` of type `BigInteger` and creates a discrete logarithm prover input using the `DLogProtocol.DLogProverInput` constructor. The resulting prover input is added to the `_dLogSecrets` array buffer. The method throws an exception if the same prover input has already been added. The method returns the `ProverBuilder` object to allow for method chaining.\n\nThe `build` method creates a `Prover` object using the secrets that have been added to the `ProverBuilder`. The method first combines the master key and the EIP-3 secret keys into a single sequence of secret keys. It then creates an `AppkitProvingInterpreter` object using the secret keys, DLog secrets, DHT secrets, and ErgoLikeParameters. Finally, it creates a `Prover` object using the `AppkitProvingInterpreter` and the `networkPrefix`. The `Prover` object can be used to create proofs for transactions on the Ergo blockchain.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval parameters = new ErgoLikeParameters(...)\nval networkPrefix = NetworkPrefix.MainnetPrefix\nval proverBuilder = new ProverBuilder(parameters, networkPrefix)\nproverBuilder.withMnemonic(mnemonicPhrase, mnemonicPass, usePre1627KeyDerivation)\nproverBuilder.withEip3Secret(index)\nproverBuilder.withDHTData(g, h, u, v, x)\nproverBuilder.withDLogSecret(x)\nval prover = proverBuilder.build()\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The class extends the `ErgoLikeInterpreter` class and overrides its `CTX` type with `ErgoLikeContext`. It also imports various classes and objects from the SDK and other libraries.\n\n## reduce Method\n\nThe `reduce` method takes in three parameters: `env`, `ergoTree`, and `context`. It reduces the given `ErgoTree` in the given context to the sigma proposition. The method returns a data object containing enough data to sign a transaction without context. \n\nThe `initCost` is calculated by adding the complexity of the `ErgoTree` and the `initCost` of the context. If the `remainingLimit` is less than or equal to 0, a `CostLimitException` is thrown. The `ctxUpdInitCost` is the context with the updated `initCost`. The `fullReduction` method is called with the `ergoTree`, `ctxUpdInitCost`, and `env` as parameters. The result of the `fullReduction` method and the `extension` of the `ctxUpdInitCost` are used to create a `ReducedInputData` object which is returned.\n\n## reduceTransaction Method\n\nThe `reduceTransaction` method takes in three parameters: `unreducedTx`, `stateContext`, and `baseCost`. It reduces inputs of the given unsigned transaction to provable sigma propositions using the given context. The method returns a new reduced transaction with all inputs reduced and the cost of this transaction. \n\nThe `unsignedTx`, `boxesToSpend`, `dataBoxes`, and `tokensToBurn` are extracted from the `unreducedTx`. The `inputTokens` and `outputTokens` are extracted from the `boxesToSpend` and `unsignedTx.outputCandidates`, respectively. The `tokenDiff` is calculated by subtracting `inputTokens` from `outputTokens`. If `tokenDiff` is not empty, the method checks if tokens are to be burnt or minted. If tokens are to be burnt, the method checks if the requested tokens to burn match the tokens to be burnt. If tokens are to be minted, the method checks if only one token is being minted and if the token id is valid. \n\nThe `initialCost` is calculated by adding the interpreter initialization cost, the input cost multiplied by the number of inputs, the data input cost multiplied by the number of data inputs, and the output cost multiplied by the number of output candidates. The `maxCost` is the maximum cost of the block. The `startCost` is the sum of the `baseCost` and the `initialCost`. The `transactionContext` is created with the boxes to spend, data inputs, and unsigned transaction. The `outAssets` and `outAssetsNum` are extracted from the `unsignedTx.outputCandidates`. The `inAssets` and `inAssetsNum` are extracted from the `boxesToSpend`. The `totalAssetsAccessCost` is calculated by adding the token access cost multiplied by the sum of `outAssetsNum` and `inAssetsNum` and the token access cost multiplied by the sum of the sizes of `inAssets` and `outAssets`. The `txCost` is the sum of the `startCost` and the `totalAssetsAccessCost`. \n\nThe method then iterates through the `boxesToSpend` and creates a new `ErgoLikeContext` for each input. The `reduce` method is called with the `Interpreter.emptyEnv`, the `ergoTree` of the input box, and the context as parameters. The result of the `reduce` method and the `currentCost` are used to create a `ReducedInputData` object which is added to the `reducedInputs` array builder. The `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` is created with the `unsignedTx` and the `reducedInputs`. The `ReducedTransaction` is created with the `reducedTx` and the `currentCost`. \n\nOverall, the `ReducingInterpreter` class provides methods to reduce an `ErgoTree` to a sigma proposition and to reduce inputs of an unsigned transaction to provable sigma propositions using a given context.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What methods does the `ReducingInterpreter` class have?\n- The `ReducingInterpreter` class has two methods: `reduce` and `reduceTransaction`.\n\n3. What exceptions can be thrown by the `reduce` method?\n- The `reduce` method can throw a `CostLimitException` if the estimated execution cost exceeds the limit.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/ReducingInterpreter.md"}}],["430",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/SecretString.scala)\n\nThe code defines a class called SecretString that encapsulates a secret array of characters (char[]) with proper equality. The class provides a more secure and safe way of handling secret data than using char[] directly. The secret data can be erased in memory and not leaked to GC. \n\nThe SecretString class has several methods that allow for creating new instances, checking if the string is empty, extracting secret characters as an array, erasing secret characters stored in the instance, and returning an unsecured String with secret characters. \n\nThe create method creates a new instance of SecretString by wrapping the given characters or copying characters from the given String. The empty method creates a new instance with an empty sequence of characters. \n\nThe SecretString class has a private erased flag that is set to true when the erase method is called. Calling any methods after erase() will throw a runtime exception. The checkErased method is used to check if the SecretString is erased before executing any method. \n\nThe getData method returns the secret characters as an array. The erase method erases the secret characters stored in the instance so that they are no longer in memory. The toStringUnsecure method returns an unsecured String with secret characters. The secret characters are copied to the new String instance and cannot be erased in memory. \n\nThe SecretString class is a useful tool for securely handling secret data in a project.

How can a new instance of SecretString be created?\n- A new instance of SecretString can be created using the static methods `create` with either an array of characters or a String, or `empty` to create an instance with an empty sequence of characters.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `erase` method and what happens when it is called?\n- The `erase` method erases the secret characters stored in the instance so that they no longer reside in memory. When called, it fills the array with spaces and sets the erased flag to true. Any subsequent method calls on the instance will throw a runtime exception.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/SecretString.md"}}],["431",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/Transactions.scala)\n\nThe code defines three case classes: `UnreducedTransaction`, `ReducedTransaction`, and `SignedTransaction`. These classes represent different stages of a transaction in the Ergo blockchain platform. \n\n`UnreducedTransaction` represents a transaction that can be reduced to a `ReducedTransaction`. It takes in four parameters: `unsignedTx`, `boxesToSpend`, `dataInputs`, and `tokensToBurn`. `unsignedTx` is the original unsigned transaction that holds the message to sign. `boxesToSpend` is a sequence of input boxes of the transaction. `dataInputs` is a sequence of data inputs of the transaction. `tokensToBurn` is a sequence of requested tokens to be burnt in the transaction. If it is empty, no burning is allowed. The class also has two `require` statements that check if the length of `unsignedTx.inputs` is equal to the length of `boxesToSpend` and if the length of `unsignedTx.dataInputs` is equal to the length of `dataInputs`. It also has a private method `checkSameIds` that checks if the box ids of `unsignedTx.inputs` and `boxesToSpend` are the same and if the box ids of `unsignedTx.dataInputs` and `dataInputs` are the same.\n\n`ReducedTransaction` represents the result of a transaction reduction by `ReducingInterpreter`. It takes in two parameters: `ergoTx` and `cost`. `ergoTx` is the reduced transaction, and `cost` is the cost of the reduction.\n\n`SignedTransaction` represents the result of a transaction signing by a prover like `Prover`. It takes in two parameters: `ergoTx` and `cost`. `ergoTx` is the signed transaction, and `cost` is the cost of the signing.\n\nThese classes are used in the larger Ergo blockchain platform to represent different stages of a transaction. For example, `UnreducedTransaction` is used to represent an unsigned transaction that needs to be reduced to a `ReducedTransaction`. `ReducedTransaction` is used to represent the result of the reduction, and `SignedTransaction` is used to represent the result of signing the transaction. These classes can be used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Ergo platform to create, validate, and execute transactions on the blockchain. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval unsignedTx = new UnsignedErgoLikeTransaction(...)\nval boxesToSpend = IndexedSeq(new ExtendedInputBox(...), new ExtendedInputBox(...))\nval dataInputs = IndexedSeq(new ErgoBox(...), new ErgoBox(...))\nval tokensToBurn = IndexedSeq(new ErgoToken(...), new ErgoToken(...))\nval unreducedTx = UnreducedTransaction(unsignedTx, boxesToSpend, dataInputs, tokensToBurn)\n\nval reducingInterpreter = new ReducingInterpreter(...)\nval reducedTx = reducingInterpreter.reduce(unreducedTx)\n\nval prover = new Prover(...)\nval signedTx = prover.sign(reducedTx)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

It takes three projection functions as arguments: `l`, `r`, and `inner`. The `l` function is executed for each element of the `left` map, the `r` function is executed for each element of the `right` map, and the `inner` function is executed for matching items `(K, L)` and `(K, R)` with the same key `K`. The function returns a map of `(K, O)` pairs, where each key comes from either the `left` or `right` map and values are produced by the projections. \n\nThe `mapReduce` function is a performance-optimized deterministic mapReduce primitive. It takes an array `arr` to be mapped to `(K, V)` pairs, a mapper function `m`, and a value reduction function `r`. The function returns a pair of arrays `(keys, values)`, where keys appear in the order of their first production by `m`, and for each `i`, `values(i)` corresponds to `keys(i)`. \n\nThe `mapToArrays` function takes a map `m` and returns a pair of arrays `(keys, values)`, where `keys` contains all the keys in the map, and `values` contains all the values in the map. \n\nThe `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class can adapt an `ExactIntegral` instance to be used where `Integral` is required. It overrides all the methods of the `Integral` trait and delegates them to the corresponding methods of the `ExactIntegral` instance. \n\nThese utility functions can be used in various parts of the project to perform common operations such as joining maps, mapping and reducing arrays, and adapting instances of `ExactIntegral` to be used as `Integral`. \n\nExample usage of `outerJoin`:\n\n```\nval left = Map(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2)\nval right = Map(\"b\" -> 3, \"c\" -> 4)\n\nval result = Utils.outerJoin(left, right)(\n  (k, l) => l.toString,\n  (k, r) => r.toString,\n  (k, l, r) => s\"$l and $r\"\n)\n\n// result: Map(a -> 1, b -> 2 and 3, c -> 4)\n```\n\nExample usage of `mapReduce`:\n\n```\nval arr = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nval (keys, values) = Utils.mapReduce(arr, (i: Int) => (i % 2, i), (v1: Int, v2: Int) => v1 + v2)\n\n// keys: Array(1, 0)\n// values: Array(6, 9)\n```\n\nExample usage of `mapToArrays`:\n\n```\nval m = Map(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2, \"c\" -> 3)\n\nval (keys, values) = Utils.mapToArrays(m)\n\n// keys: Array(a, b, c)\n// values: Array(1, 2, 3)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What does the `outerJoin` function do and how does it handle matching items?\n- The `outerJoin` function performs an outer join operation between two maps, with optional projection functions for each map and a projection function for matching items. It returns a map of (K, O) pairs, where each key comes from either the left or right collection and values are produced by projections. Matching items are handled by executing the inner projection function for (K, L, R) pairs with the same key K.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `mapReduce` function and how is it optimized for performance?\n- The `mapReduce` function is a performance-optimized deterministic mapReduce primitive that maps an array to (K, V) pairs and reduces values by key. It returns a pair of arrays (keys, values), where keys appear in order of their first production by the mapper function and values correspond to keys. It is optimized for performance by using a HashMap to track key positions and an ArrayBuilder to construct the keys and values arrays.\n\n3. What is the `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class and how does it adapt an `ExactIntegral` instance?\n- The `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class adapts an `ExactIntegral` instance to be used where `Integral` is required. It overrides the `Integral` methods with equivalent methods from `ExactIntegral`. It also provides a `parseString` method that throws a `NotImplementedError` since it is not supported by `ExactIntegral`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/Utils.md"}}],["433",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/utils/ArithUtils.scala)\n\nThe `ArithUtils` object in the `org.ergoplatform.sdk.utils` package provides two methods for performing arithmetic operations on `Long` values. The first method, `addExact`, adds two `Long` values and returns the result. If the addition operation results in an overflow, the method returns `Long.MaxValue`. The method is implemented using the bitwise XOR operator to check for overflow. If the XOR of the two input values and the sum of the two input values is negative, then an overflow has occurred.\n\nThe second method, `addExact`, is an overloaded version of the first method that allows for an arbitrary number of `Long` values to be added together. The method uses the `foldLeft` method to iterate over the input values and accumulate the sum using the `addExact` method.\n\nThe third method, `multiplyExact`, multiplies two `Long` values and returns the result. If the multiplication operation results in an overflow, the method returns `Long.MaxValue`. The method is implemented using the `java7.compat.Math.multiplyExact` method, which throws an exception if an overflow occurs. The method catches the exception and returns `Long.MaxValue` instead.\n\nThese methods can be used in the larger project to perform arithmetic operations on `Long` values with the added safety of checking for overflow. This is particularly important in cryptographic applications where overflow can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, the `addExact` method could be used to add together the outputs of multiple cryptographic operations, while the `multiplyExact` method could be used to calculate the size of a data structure based on the number of elements and the size of each element. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval a = 9223372036854775807L // Long.MaxValue\nval b = 1L\nval c = 2L\nval d = 3L\nval sum = ArithUtils.addExact(a, b, c, d) // returns Long.MaxValue\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `ArithUtils` object?\n- The `ArithUtils` object provides methods for performing arithmetic operations on long values while handling overflow conditions.\n\n2.

What does the `multiplyExact` method do?\n- The `multiplyExact` method multiplies two long values and returns the product, but if there is any overflow, it returns `Long.MaxValue`.

This is particularly important in cryptographic applications where overflow can lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe first method, `addExact`, takes two `Long` values as input and returns their sum. If the addition operation results in an overflow, the method returns `Long.MaxValue`. The method checks for overflow using the bitwise XOR operator. If the XOR of the two input values and the sum of the two input values is negative, then an overflow has occurred.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval a = 9223372036854775807L // Long.MaxValue\nval b = 1L\nval sum = ArithUtils.addExact(a, b) // returns Long.MaxValue\n```\n\nThe second method, `addExact`, is an overloaded version of the first method that allows for an arbitrary number of `Long` values to be added together. The method uses the `foldLeft` method to iterate over the input values and accumulate the sum using the `addExact` method.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval a = 9223372036854775807L // Long.MaxValue\nval b = 1L\nval c = 2L\nval d = 3L\nval sum = ArithUtils.addExact(a, b, c, d) // returns Long.MaxValue\n```\n\nThe third method, `multiplyExact`, multiplies two `Long` values and returns the result. If the multiplication operation results in an overflow, the method returns `Long.MaxValue`. The method is implemented using the `java7.compat.Math.multiplyExact` method, which throws an exception if an overflow occurs. The method catches the exception and returns `Long.MaxValue` instead.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval a = 9223372036854775807L // Long.MaxValue\nval b = 2L\nval product = ArithUtils.multiplyExact(a, b) // returns Long.MaxValue\n```\n\nThese methods can be used in the larger project to perform arithmetic operations on `Long` values with the added safety of checking for overflow. For example, the `addExact` method could be used to add together the outputs of multiple cryptographic operations, while the `multiplyExact` method could be used to calculate the size of a data structure based on the number of elements and the size of each element.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/utils/summary.md"}}],["435",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](sigmastate-interpreterhttps://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/wallet/AssetUtils.scala)\n\nThe `AssetUtils` object provides utility functions for working with token assets in the Ergo blockchain. The functions are designed to work with `TokensMap`, which is a type alias for `Map[ModifierId, Long]`. The `ModifierId` is a unique identifier for a transaction output, and the `Long` value represents the amount of tokens associated with that output.\n\nThe `mergeAssetsMut` function takes a mutable map `into` and one or more `TokensMap` instances `from`. It merges the `from` maps into the `into` map by adding the token amounts for each `ModifierId`. If a `ModifierId` is present in both the `into` and `from` maps, the amounts are added together. This function modifies the `into` map in place.\n\n```scala\nval into: mutable.Map[ModifierId, Long] = mutable.Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 100L\n)\nval from1: TokensMap = Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(1.toByte) -> 50L\n)\nval from2: TokensMap = Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 25L\n)\nAssetUtils.mergeAssetsMut(into, from1, from2)\n// into now contains:\n// Map(\n//   ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 125L,\n//   ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(1.toByte) -> 50L\n// )\n```\n\nThe `mergeAssets` function is similar to `mergeAssetsMut`, but it returns a new `TokensMap` instead of modifying an existing one. It takes an initial `TokensMap` and one or more additional `TokensMap` instances to merge into it. The resulting `TokensMap` contains the merged token amounts.\n\n```scala\nval initialMap: TokensMap = Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 100L\n)\nval map1: TokensMap = Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(1.toByte) -> 50L\n)\nval map2: TokensMap = Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 25L\n)\nval merged: TokensMap = AssetUtils.mergeAssets(initialMap, map1, map2)\n// merged contains:\n// Map(\n//   ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 125L,\n//   ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(1.toByte) -> 50L\n// )\n```\n\nThe `subtractAssets` function takes an initial `TokensMap` and one or more `TokensMap` instances to subtract from it. It returns a new `TokensMap` with the token amounts subtracted. If a `ModifierId` is present in both the initial map and the subtractor maps, the amounts are subtracted from the initial map. If the resulting amount is zero, the `ModifierId` is removed from the map.\n\n```scala\nval initialMap: TokensMap = Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 100L,\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(1.toByte) -> 50L\n)\nval subtractor1: TokensMap = Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 25L\n)\nval subtractor2: TokensMap = Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(1.toByte) -> 75L\n)\nval subtracted: TokensMap = AssetUtils.subtractAssets(initialMap, subtractor1, subtractor2)\n// subtracted contains:\n// Map(\n//   ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 75L\n// )\n```\n\nThe `subtractAssetsMut` function takes a mutable map `from` and a `TokensMap` `subtractor`. It subtracts the token amounts in the `subtractor` map from the `from` map. If the resulting amount is zero, the `ModifierId` is removed from the `from` map. This function modifies the `from` map in place.\n\n```scala\nval from: mutable.Map[ModifierId, Long] = mutable.Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 100L,\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(1.toByte) -> 50L\n)\nval subtractor: TokensMap = Map(\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 25L,\n  ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(1.toByte) -> 75L\n)\nAssetUtils.subtractAssetsMut(from, subtractor)\n// from now contains:\n// Map(\n//   ModifierId @@ Array.fill(32)(0.toByte) -> 75L\n// )\n```\n\nOverall, these utility functions provide a convenient way to work with token assets in the Ergo blockchain.

This can be useful in the context of a cryptocurrency wallet, where a user may hold multiple types of tokens and need to keep track of their balances. \n\nFor example, if a user has 10 Ergo tokens and 5 Bitcoin tokens in their wallet, the TokensMap could be represented as follows:\n\n```\nval tokens: TokensMap = Map(\n  ModifierId(\"ErgoToken\") -> 10L,\n  ModifierId(\"BitcoinToken\") -> 5L\n)\n```\n\nThis code can be used in conjunction with other parts of the project to implement wallet functionality, such as displaying token balances to the user or performing transactions between different token types. \n\nOverall, the TokensMap type alias provides a simple and flexible way to represent token balances within the Ergo Platform SDK.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The algorithm to compute the child key depends on whether the child is a hardened key or not, and whether we're talking about private or public keys. The trait does not provide an implementation for this method, but it is expected to be implemented in derived classes.\n\nThe `derive(upPath: DerivationPath): T` method is used to derive a child key from a parent key given a derivation path. The method checks that the given derivation path is compatible with the current path and then iteratively computes the child key using the `child` method. \n\nOverall, this code provides a foundation for working with extended keys in a cryptocurrency wallet. It allows for the computation of child keys from parent keys and provides a way to represent extended keys as tuples of the key and chain code. This trait can be extended to provide implementations for specific cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\n// create a Bitcoin extended private key\nval privateKey = new BitcoinExtendedPrivateKey(k, c, path)\n\n// derive a child key from the parent key\nval childKey = privateKey.derive(DerivationPath(\"m/0/1\"))\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `key` method returns an instance of `ProveDlog` which represents the public key. The `child` method takes an integer `idx` and returns a new instance of `ExtendedPublicKey` representing the child public key at the given index. The `ExtendedPublicKey` class also overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods.\n\nThe `ExtendedPublicKey` object has a method called `deriveChildPublicKey` which takes a parent public key and an integer `idx` and returns a new instance of `ExtendedPublicKey` representing the child public key at the given index.
