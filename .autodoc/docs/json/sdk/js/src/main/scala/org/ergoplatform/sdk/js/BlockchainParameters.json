  "summary": "The code defines a class called \"BlockchainParameters\" which extends the \"ErgoLikeParameters\" class. This class is used to represent the parameters of a blockchain network. The class has several properties such as \"storageFeeFactor\", \"minValuePerByte\", \"maxBlockSize\", \"tokenAccessCost\", \"inputCost\", \"dataInputCost\", \"outputCost\", \"maxBlockCost\", \"_softForkStartingHeight\", \"_softForkVotesCollected\", and \"blockVersion\". These properties are used to define the various parameters of the blockchain network.\n\nThe class also has two methods called \"softForkStartingHeight\" and \"softForkVotesCollected\". These methods are used to retrieve the soft-fork starting height and the votes for soft-fork collected in previous epochs respectively. The methods use the \"Isos.isoUndefOr\" method to convert the \"UndefOr\" type to an \"Option\" type.\n\nThe class is annotated with \"@JSExportTopLevel\" which means that it can be exported to JavaScript. This allows the class to be used in a JavaScript environment.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to define the parameters of the blockchain network. For example, the \"maxBlockSize\" property can be used to define the maximum size of a block in the blockchain network. The \"inputCost\" property can be used to define the cost of adding an input to a transaction. The \"outputCost\" property can be used to define the cost of adding an output to a transaction. The \"softForkStartingHeight\" and \"softForkVotesCollected\" methods can be used to retrieve information about the soft-fork starting height and the votes for soft-fork collected in previous epochs respectively.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval params = new BlockchainParameters(\n  storageFeeFactor = 100,\n  minValuePerByte = 1,\n  maxBlockSize = 1000000,\n  tokenAccessCost = 10,\n  inputCost = 100,\n  dataInputCost = 50,\n  outputCost = 50,\n  maxBlockCost = 100000000,\n  _softForkStartingHeight = Some(100),\n  _softForkVotesCollected = Some(100),\n  blockVersion = 1\n)\n\nval maxBlockSize = params.maxBlockSize // returns 1000000\nval softForkStartingHeight = params.softForkStartingHeight // returns Some(100)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   This code defines a class called `BlockchainParameters` that extends `ErgoLikeParameters` and contains various parameters related to the blockchain, such as storage fee factor and max block size.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `@JSExportTopLevel` annotation?\n   The `@JSExportTopLevel` annotation is used to export the `BlockchainParameters` class as a top-level object in the generated JavaScript code, making it accessible from outside the module.\n\n3. What is the role of the `Isos` object and how is it used in this code?\n   The `Isos` object provides isomorphisms (bi-directional transformations) between different types, and is used in this code to convert between `UndefOr[Int]` and `Option[Int]` types for the `softForkStartingHeight` and `softForkVotesCollected` methods."
