                      "summary": "The folder `.autodoc/docs/json/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform` contains the Scala source code for the shared components of the Ergo Platform SDK. These components are essential for the functioning of the Ergo Platform and can be used by other parts of the project or external applications that interact with the Ergo blockchain.\n\nHere is a brief overview of the files and subfolders in this folder:\n\n### Files\n\n1. `ErgoLikeContext.scala`: This file defines the `ErgoLikeContext` case class, which represents the context of a transaction in the Ergo blockchain. It contains information such as the current height of the blockchain, the transaction's inputs and outputs, and the data inputs. This class is used in various parts of the project, such as transaction validation and smart contract execution.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```scala\n   val ctx = ErgoLikeContext(currentHeight, spendingTransaction, dataInputs)\n   ```\n\n2. `ErgoLikeTransaction.scala`: This file defines the `ErgoLikeTransaction` case class, which represents a transaction in the Ergo blockchain. It contains information such as the transaction's inputs, outputs, and data inputs. This class is used in various parts of the project, such as transaction creation and validation.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```scala\n   val tx = ErgoLikeTransaction(inputs, dataInputs, outputs)\n   ```\n\n3. `ErgoBox.scala`: This file defines the `ErgoBox` case class, which represents a box (i.e., an unspent transaction output) in the Ergo blockchain. It contains information such as the box's value, the script that locks the box, and any additional registers that store custom data. This class is used in various parts of the project, such as transaction creation and smart contract execution.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```scala\n   val box = ErgoBox(value, script, additionalRegisters)\n   ```\n\n### Subfolders\n\n1. `appkit`: This subfolder contains the source code for the Ergo Appkit, a set of utility classes and functions that simplify the development of applications that interact with the Ergo blockchain. It includes classes for managing wallets, creating and signing transactions, and working with ErgoScript (the smart contract language used by Ergo).\n\n2. `ergoWallet`: This subfolder contains the source code for the Ergo Wallet, a component that manages the user's private keys and allows them to create and sign transactions. It includes classes for key management, address generation, and transaction signing.\n\n3. `nodeView`: This subfolder contains the source code for the Node View component, which is responsible for managing the local view of the Ergo blockchain. It includes classes for managing the state of the blockchain, the transaction pool, and the history of the blockchain.\n\n4. `settings`: This subfolder contains the source code for the Settings component, which is responsible for managing the configuration of the Ergo Platform. It includes classes for parsing configuration files and managing runtime settings.\n\nIn summary, the code in this folder provides the core functionality for the Ergo Platform SDK, which can be used by other parts of the project or external applications that interact with the Ergo blockchain. The shared components include classes for managing transactions, boxes, and the context of the Ergo blockchain, as well as utility classes for application development, wallet management, and node view management.",
