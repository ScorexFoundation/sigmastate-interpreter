  "summary": "The code defines a trait called ErgoLikeParameters, which represents a set of blockchain parameters that can be readjusted via miners voting and voting-related data. These parameters are included in the extension section of the first block of a voting epoch. \n\nThe trait contains several methods that return the values of different parameters. These parameters include the cost of storing 1 byte in UTXO for four years, the cost of a transaction output, the max block size, the cost of a token contained in a transaction, the cost of a transaction input, the cost of a transaction data input, the cost of a transaction output, and the computation units limit per block. \n\nIn addition to these parameters, the trait also includes methods that return the height when voting for a soft-fork had been started, the votes for soft-fork collected in previous epochs, and the protocol version. \n\nThis code is likely used in a larger project that involves blockchain technology and mining. The ErgoLikeParameters trait provides a way to read and adjust various blockchain parameters that can affect the behavior of the blockchain. These parameters can be adjusted via miners voting and voting-related data, which allows for decentralized decision-making. \n\nHere is an example of how one of these methods might be used:\n\n```\nval params: ErgoLikeParameters = // get parameters from somewhere\nval storageFeeFactor: Int = params.storageFeeFactor\nprintln(s\"Cost of storing 1 byte in UTXO for four years: $storageFeeFactor nanoErgs\")\n```\n\nThis code gets the storageFeeFactor parameter from an instance of ErgoLikeParameters and prints it to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   \n   This code defines a trait called ErgoLikeParameters which contains various parameters related to the blockchain, such as the cost of storing data, transaction output, input, and token access, as well as the maximum block size and computation units limit per block. It also includes fields related to miners voting and voting-related data.\n\n2. What are the expected data types for the return values of the methods defined in this trait?\n   \n   The return types for the methods defined in this trait are all Int, except for softForkStartingHeight and softForkVotesCollected which are both Option[Int], and blockVersion which is Byte.\n\n3. Are all the parameters defined in this trait adjustable via miners voting or just some of them?\n   \n   It is not explicitly stated which parameters are adjustable via miners voting, but it is mentioned that all the fields included in the extension section of a first block of a voting epoch are related to miners voting and voting-related data. Therefore, it can be assumed that all the parameters defined in this trait may be adjustable via miners voting."
