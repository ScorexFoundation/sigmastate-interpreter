  "summary": "The `Utils` object contains several utility functions that can be used across the project. \n\nThe `outerJoin` function performs an outer join operation between two maps, `left` and `right`. It takes three projection functions as arguments: `l`, `r`, and `inner`. The `l` function is executed for each element of the `left` map, the `r` function is executed for each element of the `right` map, and the `inner` function is executed for matching items `(K, L)` and `(K, R)` with the same key `K`. The function returns a map of `(K, O)` pairs, where each key comes from either the `left` or `right` map and values are produced by the projections. \n\nThe `mapReduce` function is a performance-optimized deterministic mapReduce primitive. It takes an array `arr` to be mapped to `(K, V)` pairs, a mapper function `m`, and a value reduction function `r`. The function returns a pair of arrays `(keys, values)`, where keys appear in the order of their first production by `m`, and for each `i`, `values(i)` corresponds to `keys(i)`. \n\nThe `mapToArrays` function takes a map `m` and returns a pair of arrays `(keys, values)`, where `keys` contains all the keys in the map, and `values` contains all the values in the map. \n\nThe `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class can adapt an `ExactIntegral` instance to be used where `Integral` is required. It overrides all the methods of the `Integral` trait and delegates them to the corresponding methods of the `ExactIntegral` instance. \n\nThese utility functions can be used in various parts of the project to perform common operations such as joining maps, mapping and reducing arrays, and adapting instances of `ExactIntegral` to be used as `Integral`. \n\nExample usage of `outerJoin`:\n\n```\nval left = Map(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2)\nval right = Map(\"b\" -> 3, \"c\" -> 4)\n\nval result = Utils.outerJoin(left, right)(\n  (k, l) => l.toString,\n  (k, r) => r.toString,\n  (k, l, r) => s\"$l and $r\"\n)\n\n// result: Map(a -> 1, b -> 2 and 3, c -> 4)\n```\n\nExample usage of `mapReduce`:\n\n```\nval arr = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nval (keys, values) = Utils.mapReduce(arr, (i: Int) => (i % 2, i), (v1: Int, v2: Int) => v1 + v2)\n\n// keys: Array(1, 0)\n// values: Array(6, 9)\n```\n\nExample usage of `mapToArrays`:\n\n```\nval m = Map(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2, \"c\" -> 3)\n\nval (keys, values) = Utils.mapToArrays(m)\n\n// keys: Array(a, b, c)\n// values: Array(1, 2, 3)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What does the `outerJoin` function do and how does it handle matching items?\n- The `outerJoin` function performs an outer join operation between two maps, with optional projection functions for each map and a projection function for matching items. It returns a map of (K, O) pairs, where each key comes from either the left or right collection and values are produced by projections. Matching items are handled by executing the inner projection function for (K, L, R) pairs with the same key K.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `mapReduce` function and how is it optimized for performance?\n- The `mapReduce` function is a performance-optimized deterministic mapReduce primitive that maps an array to (K, V) pairs and reduces values by key. It returns a pair of arrays (keys, values), where keys appear in order of their first production by the mapper function and values correspond to keys. It is optimized for performance by using a HashMap to track key positions and an ArrayBuilder to construct the keys and values arrays.\n\n3. What is the `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class and how does it adapt an `ExactIntegral` instance?\n- The `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class adapts an `ExactIntegral` instance to be used where `Integral` is required. It overrides the `Integral` methods with equivalent methods from `ExactIntegral`. It also provides a `parseString` method that throws a `NotImplementedError` since it is not supported by `ExactIntegral`."
