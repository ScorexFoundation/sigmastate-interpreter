  "summary": "The `ArithUtils` object in the `org.ergoplatform.sdk.utils` package provides two methods for performing arithmetic operations on `Long` values. The first method, `addExact`, adds two `Long` values and returns the result. If the addition operation results in an overflow, the method returns `Long.MaxValue`. The method is implemented using the bitwise XOR operator to check for overflow. If the XOR of the two input values and the sum of the two input values is negative, then an overflow has occurred.\n\nThe second method, `addExact`, is an overloaded version of the first method that allows for an arbitrary number of `Long` values to be added together. The method uses the `foldLeft` method to iterate over the input values and accumulate the sum using the `addExact` method.\n\nThe third method, `multiplyExact`, multiplies two `Long` values and returns the result. If the multiplication operation results in an overflow, the method returns `Long.MaxValue`. The method is implemented using the `java7.compat.Math.multiplyExact` method, which throws an exception if an overflow occurs. The method catches the exception and returns `Long.MaxValue` instead.\n\nThese methods can be used in the larger project to perform arithmetic operations on `Long` values with the added safety of checking for overflow. This is particularly important in cryptographic applications where overflow can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, the `addExact` method could be used to add together the outputs of multiple cryptographic operations, while the `multiplyExact` method could be used to calculate the size of a data structure based on the number of elements and the size of each element. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval a = 9223372036854775807L // Long.MaxValue\nval b = 1L\nval c = 2L\nval d = 3L\nval sum = ArithUtils.addExact(a, b, c, d) // returns Long.MaxValue\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ArithUtils` object?\n- The `ArithUtils` object provides methods for performing arithmetic operations on long values while handling overflow conditions.\n\n2. What does the `addExact` method do?\n- The `addExact` method adds two or more long values and returns the sum, but if there is any overflow, it returns `Long.MaxValue`.\n\n3. What does the `multiplyExact` method do?\n- The `multiplyExact` method multiplies two long values and returns the product, but if there is any overflow, it returns `Long.MaxValue`. It uses the `java7.compat.Math.multiplyExact` method to perform the multiplication."
