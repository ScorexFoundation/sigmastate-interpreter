  "summary": "The code defines three case classes: `UnreducedTransaction`, `ReducedTransaction`, and `SignedTransaction`. These classes represent different stages of a transaction in the Ergo blockchain platform. \n\n`UnreducedTransaction` represents a transaction that can be reduced to a `ReducedTransaction`. It takes in four parameters: `unsignedTx`, `boxesToSpend`, `dataInputs`, and `tokensToBurn`. `unsignedTx` is the original unsigned transaction that holds the message to sign. `boxesToSpend` is a sequence of input boxes of the transaction. `dataInputs` is a sequence of data inputs of the transaction. `tokensToBurn` is a sequence of requested tokens to be burnt in the transaction. If it is empty, no burning is allowed. The class also has two `require` statements that check if the length of `unsignedTx.inputs` is equal to the length of `boxesToSpend` and if the length of `unsignedTx.dataInputs` is equal to the length of `dataInputs`. It also has a private method `checkSameIds` that checks if the box ids of `unsignedTx.inputs` and `boxesToSpend` are the same and if the box ids of `unsignedTx.dataInputs` and `dataInputs` are the same.\n\n`ReducedTransaction` represents the result of a transaction reduction by `ReducingInterpreter`. It takes in two parameters: `ergoTx` and `cost`. `ergoTx` is the reduced transaction, and `cost` is the cost of the reduction.\n\n`SignedTransaction` represents the result of a transaction signing by a prover like `Prover`. It takes in two parameters: `ergoTx` and `cost`. `ergoTx` is the signed transaction, and `cost` is the cost of the signing.\n\nThese classes are used in the larger Ergo blockchain platform to represent different stages of a transaction. For example, `UnreducedTransaction` is used to represent an unsigned transaction that needs to be reduced to a `ReducedTransaction`. `ReducedTransaction` is used to represent the result of the reduction, and `SignedTransaction` is used to represent the result of signing the transaction. These classes can be used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Ergo platform to create, validate, and execute transactions on the blockchain. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval unsignedTx = new UnsignedErgoLikeTransaction(...)\nval boxesToSpend = IndexedSeq(new ExtendedInputBox(...), new ExtendedInputBox(...))\nval dataInputs = IndexedSeq(new ErgoBox(...), new ErgoBox(...))\nval tokensToBurn = IndexedSeq(new ErgoToken(...), new ErgoToken(...))\nval unreducedTx = UnreducedTransaction(unsignedTx, boxesToSpend, dataInputs, tokensToBurn)\n\nval reducingInterpreter = new ReducingInterpreter(...)\nval reducedTx = reducingInterpreter.reduce(unreducedTx)\n\nval prover = new Prover(...)\nval signedTx = prover.sign(reducedTx)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `UnreducedTransaction` class and its parameters?\n- The `UnreducedTransaction` class represents a transaction data that can be reduced to `ReducedTransaction`. Its parameters include the original unsigned transaction to be reduced, input boxes of the transaction, data inputs of the transaction, and requested tokens to be burnt in the transaction.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `checkSameIds` method?\n- The `checkSameIds` method is a private helper method that checks if two sequences of box IDs have the same IDs in the same order. It is used to ensure that `unsignedTx` and `boxesToSpend`, as well as `unsignedTx` and `dataInputs`, have the same box IDs in the same order.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `SignedTransaction` case class?\n- The `SignedTransaction` case class represents the results for transaction signing by a prover like `Prover`. Its parameters include the signed transaction and the cost of signing the transaction."
