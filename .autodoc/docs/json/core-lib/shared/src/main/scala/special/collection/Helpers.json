  "summary": "The code above is a helper object that provides a method for checking if two collections have the same length. The purpose of this code is to ensure that collections being compared have the same number of elements, which is a common requirement in many algorithms and operations.\n\nThe `Helpers` object contains a private method called `sameLengthErrorMsg` that takes two collections of different types `A` and `B` as input parameters. This method returns an error message string that indicates the lengths of the two collections and their contents. The error message is used to inform the user that the collections being compared do not have the same length.\n\nThe `requireSameLength` method is a public method that takes two collections of different types `A` and `B` as input parameters. This method uses the `require` function to check if the lengths of the two collections are equal. If the lengths are not equal, the `sameLengthErrorMsg` method is called to generate an error message that is then thrown as an exception.\n\nThis code can be used in a larger project to ensure that collections being compared have the same length. For example, if a project requires comparing two arrays of data, this code can be used to ensure that the arrays have the same number of elements before performing any operations on them. \n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```scala\nimport special.collection.Helpers._\n\nval arr1 = Array(1, 2, 3)\nval arr2 = Array(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n\nrequireSameLength(arr1, arr2) // throws an exception with an error message\n```\n\nIn this example, the `requireSameLength` method is called with two arrays of different types. Since the arrays have different lengths, the method throws an exception with an error message generated by the `sameLengthErrorMsg` method.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Helpers` object?\n   - The `Helpers` object contains a method for checking if two collections have the same length.\n\n2. What type of collections are expected as input to the `requireSameLength` method?\n   - The `requireSameLength` method expects two collections of potentially different types, `Coll[A]` and `Coll[B]`.\n\n3. What happens if the collections passed to `requireSameLength` have different lengths?\n   - If the collections passed to `requireSameLength` have different lengths, an exception will be thrown with an error message indicating the lengths of the collections."
