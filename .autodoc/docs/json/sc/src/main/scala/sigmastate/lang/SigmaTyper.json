  "summary": "The `SigmaTyper` class is responsible for type inference and analysis of Sigma expressions. It takes a `SigmaBuilder`, `PredefinedFuncRegistry`, and a `lowerMethodCalls` flag as input parameters. The main function of this class is `assignType`, which takes an environment, a bound value, and an optional expected type as input parameters. It recursively traverses the input expression tree and assigns types to each node, checking for type consistency and correctness.\n\nThe `assignType` function handles various cases, such as:\n\n- `Block`: It processes a block of expressions, updating the environment with new variable bindings and their types.\n- `Tuple`: It assigns types to each element of the tuple.\n- `ConcreteCollection`: It assigns types to each element of the collection and ensures that all elements have the same type.\n- `Ident`: It looks up the type of the identifier in the environment or the global method registry.\n- `Select`: It assigns types to the object and its fields, handling method calls and property access.\n- `Lambda`: It assigns types to the lambda function's arguments and body, ensuring that the declared return type matches the inferred type of the body.\n- `Apply`: It assigns types to the function and its arguments, ensuring that the function's argument types match the expected types.\n- `ApplyTypes`: It assigns types to the input expression and checks that the number of type arguments matches the expected number of type parameters.\n- `If`: It assigns types to",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SigmaTyper` class?\n   **Answer**: The `SigmaTyper` class is responsible for type inference and analysis for Sigma expressions. It checks constituent names and types, and uses the environment map to resolve bound variables and their types.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `assignType` method work?\n   **Answer**: The `assignType` method takes an environment, a bound value, and an optional expected type as input. It recursively processes the bound value based on its structure and assigns appropriate types to its constituents, using the environment to resolve variables and their types.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the role of the `predefinedEnv` variable in the `SigmaTyper` class?\n   **Answer**: The `predefinedEnv` variable is a map that holds the predefined functions and their corresponding types. It is used by the `assignType` method to resolve variables and their types during type inference and analysis."
