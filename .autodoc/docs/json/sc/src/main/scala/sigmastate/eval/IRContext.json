  "summary": "The code provided is a part of the SigmaState project and defines an IRContext trait and two classes, RuntimeIRContext and CompiletimeIRContext, that extend it. The IRContext trait provides methods and values that are used to build and manipulate SigmaState's intermediate representation (IR) of smart contracts. \n\nThe IRContext trait extends two other traits, TreeBuilding and GraphBuilding, which provide methods for building and manipulating the IR's abstract syntax tree and control flow graph, respectively. The trait also imports the SigmaProp object, which contains methods for creating and manipulating SigmaState's signature propositions. \n\nThe trait defines a builder value that is used to construct the IR, and a lazy value that defines a pass configuration that turns off constant propagation. The trait also defines two methods, findIsProven and verifyIsProven, that are used to check if a given lambda expression contains a call to the SigmaProp.isProven method and to verify that the call is the last operation in the lambda's schedule. \n\nThe RuntimeIRContext and CompiletimeIRContext classes extend the IRContext trait and are used in different contexts. The RuntimeIRContext is used by blockchain nodes to validate transactions, while the CompiletimeIRContext is used by script development tools to compile ErgoScript into ErgoTree bytecode. \n\nOverall, the code provides a set of tools and methods for building and manipulating SigmaState's IR, which is used to represent smart contracts in the Ergo blockchain. The IRContext trait and its subclasses are essential components of the SigmaState project and are used extensively throughout the codebase. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval context = new RuntimeIRContext()\nval lambda = context.builder.lambda { (ctx: Context) =>\n  val input = ctx.INPUTS(0)\n  val output = ctx.OUTPUTS(0)\n  SigmaProp.isProven(input.propositionBytes) && !SigmaProp.isProven(output.propositionBytes)\n}\ncontext.verifyIsProven(lambda) // returns Success(())\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `IRContext` trait and its two subclasses `RuntimeIRContext` and `CompiletimeIRContext`?\n   \n   The `IRContext` trait defines methods and values related to building and manipulating Sigma protocols. `RuntimeIRContext` is used for validating transactions on the blockchain, while `CompiletimeIRContext` is used for compiling ErgoScript into ErgoTree bytecode during script development.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `noConstPropagationPass` value?\n   \n   `noConstPropagationPass` is a configuration value used to turn off constant propagation during a pass. It is used in the `beginPass` method to disable constant propagation for a specific pass.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `verifyIsProven` method?\n   \n   `verifyIsProven` checks that if `SigmaProp.isProven` method calls exist in the given Lambda's schedule, then it is the last operation. This is important for ensuring that the proof system is used correctly."
