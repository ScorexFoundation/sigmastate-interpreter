  "summary": "This code is a shell script that removes various auxiliary files that are generated during the compilation of a LaTeX document. The purpose of this script is to clean up the project directory by removing unnecessary files that are generated during the compilation process.\n\nThe script uses the \"rm\" command to remove the following files: appendix_integer_encoding.aux, costing.aux, evaluation.aux, graph.aux, language.aux, serialization.aux, types.aux, spec.aux, spec.out, spec.toc, and spec.log. These files are all auxiliary files that are generated during the compilation of a LaTeX document.\n\nThe script can be used in the larger project as a part of the build process. After the LaTeX document is compiled, this script can be run to remove the auxiliary files that are no longer needed. This can help to keep the project directory clean and organized.\n\nHere is an example of how this script can be used in a larger project:\n\n```\n# Compile the LaTeX document\npdflatex my_document.tex\n\n# Remove the auxiliary files\n./cleanup.sh\n```\n\nOverall, this script serves a simple but important purpose in the larger project. By removing unnecessary files, it helps to keep the project directory clean and organized, which can make it easier to manage and maintain the project over time.",
