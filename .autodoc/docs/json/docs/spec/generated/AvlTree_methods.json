  "summary": "This file contains a set of methods for working with an AVL tree data structure. AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees, which means that they automatically adjust their structure to maintain efficient search and insertion times. \n\nThe methods in this file allow for the creation and manipulation of AVL trees, including inserting, updating, and removing nodes. The tree can also be queried to check if it contains a certain key, and to retrieve the value associated with a given key. \n\nOne important method is `digest`, which returns a digest of the state represented by the tree. This digest is a combination of the root hash bytes and the tree height, and is used to verify the integrity of the tree. \n\nAnother useful method is `enabledOperations`, which returns a byte representing the flags of enabled operations. This byte can be used to determine if insert, update, or remove operations are allowed on the tree. \n\nOverall, these methods provide a powerful set of tools for working with AVL trees in a larger project. For example, they could be used to implement a database or key-value store with efficient search and manipulation capabilities. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval tree = new AvlTree()\ntree = tree.insert(Array[Byte](1), Array[Byte](10)).get\nval value = tree.get(Array[Byte](1))\nprintln(value) // prints Some(Array[Byte](10))\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the AvlTree class?\n- The AvlTree class represents a balanced binary search tree that is used for authenticated data storage.\n\n2. What operations are allowed on the AvlTree?\n- The enabled operations on the AvlTree can be checked using the enabledOperations method, which returns a byte with flags for insert, update, and remove operations.\n\n3. How can the state of the AvlTree be updated?\n- The state of the AvlTree can be updated using the insert, update, and remove methods, which return an optional updated AvlTree. The updateDigest method can also be used to update the digest of the tree."
