      "summary": "This code is a shell script that compiles a LaTeX document called \"sigmastate_protocols\" into a PDF file. The script first checks if the necessary commands \"pdflatex\" and \"bibtex\" are installed on the system by using the \"command -v\" command. If either of these commands is not found, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.\n\nAssuming both commands are found, the script then runs \"pdflatex\" on the LaTeX document, followed by \"bibtex\" to process any bibliographic references. The \"pdflatex\" command is then run three more times to ensure that all references and cross-references are resolved correctly. Finally, the script removes some auxiliary files generated during the compilation process.\n\nThis script is likely used as part of a larger project that involves creating and maintaining LaTeX documents. It could be included as part of a build process to automatically generate PDFs from LaTeX source files. For example, a software project that includes technical documentation written in LaTeX could use this script to generate PDFs that can be distributed to users. \n\nHere is an example of how this script could be used in a larger project:\n\n```\n# Compile all LaTeX documents in the project\nfor file in *.tex; do\n    sh compile_latex.sh \"$file\"\ndone\n```\n\nIn this example, the script is called for each LaTeX file in the project directory, and the name of the file is passed as an argument to the script. This allows the script to be used for multiple documents without having to modify the script itself.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this script?\n   This script compiles a LaTeX document called \"sigmastate_protocols\" using pdflatex and bibtex, and then removes some auxiliary files.\n\n2. What are the dependencies required to run this script?\n   This script requires pdflatex and bibtex to be installed. Additional packages like fonts, etc. may also be needed.\n\n3. What is the expected output of running this script?\n   The expected output is a compiled PDF document called \"sigmastate_protocols\". Any auxiliary files generated during the compilation process are removed at the end of the script."
