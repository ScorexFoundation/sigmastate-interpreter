  "summary": "The code above defines a class called `Lazy` and an object called `Lazy`. The `Lazy` class is a non-thread safe, but efficient on a single thread, immutable lazy value. The class takes a block of code as a parameter, which is executed only once. The `value` method of the class checks if the `_isSet` variable is false. If it is false, then the block of code is executed and the `_value` variable is set to the result of the block. The `_isSet` variable is then set to true. If `_isSet` is already true, then the `_value` variable is returned. \n\nThe `isSet` method returns the value of the `_isSet` variable. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the lazy value. If `_isSet` is false, then the string \"<lazy>\" is returned. Otherwise, the `toString` method of the `_value` variable is called and its result is returned.\n\nThe `Lazy` object has a single method called `apply`. The `apply` method takes a block of code as a parameter and returns a new instance of the `Lazy` class with the block of code as its parameter.\n\nThis code can be used in a larger project to create lazy values that are only evaluated once. This can be useful for expensive computations or for values that are only needed occasionally. For example, if a project needs to compute a large dataset, it can use the `Lazy` class to create a lazy value that computes the dataset only when it is needed. This can save time and resources by avoiding unnecessary computations. \n\nHere is an example of how the `Lazy` class can be used:\n\n```\nval lazyValue = Lazy {\n  println(\"Computing expensive value...\")\n  Thread.sleep(1000)\n  42\n}\n\nprintln(\"Lazy value created.\")\nprintln(lazyValue.value)\nprintln(lazyValue.value)\n```\n\nIn this example, a new lazy value is created with a block of code that computes an expensive value (in this case, the number 42). The `println` statement before the `value` method is called shows that the lazy value is only created once. The `println` statements after the `value` method is called show that the value is cached and not recomputed.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `@volatile` keyword in front of the `_isSet` variable?\n   \n   The `@volatile` keyword ensures that the `_isSet` variable is always read from and written to main memory, rather than being cached in a thread's local memory. This is important for thread safety in multi-threaded environments.\n\n2. Can the `block` parameter of the `Lazy` class be null?\n   \n   Yes, the `block` parameter can be null, but attempting to access the `value` of a `Lazy` instance with a null `block` will result in a `NullPointerException`.\n\n3. Is the `Lazy` class thread-safe?\n   \n   No, the `Lazy` class is not thread-safe. While it is efficient on a single thread, it is not safe to use in a multi-threaded environment without additional synchronization mechanisms."
