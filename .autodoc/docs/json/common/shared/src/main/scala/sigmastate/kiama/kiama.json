  "summary": "The code is a package-level documentation for the Kiama Scala library for language processing. The library is developed by the Programming Languages Research Group at Macquarie University and is available on GitHub. The purpose of the library is to provide components for language processing, including tree decoration via attribute grammars, tree transformation via strategic term rewriting, dynamic semantics, and pretty-printing. \n\nThe `util` package contains support modules for parsing, input/output, read-eval-print loops (REPLs), and pattern matching. The `examples` package contains many examples of using Kiama to solve small to medium language processing problems. \n\nThe code defines two type constructors for partial functions. The first type constructor `==>` takes two type parameters `T` and `U` and returns a partial function from `T` to `U`. The second type constructor `===>` takes one type parameter `T` and returns a partial function from `T` to `T`. These type constructors provide a convenient way to define partial functions in Scala. \n\nOverall, this code provides an overview of the Kiama library and its components. It also defines two type constructors that can be used in the library or in other Scala projects.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the Kiama library?\n   - The Kiama library is a Scala library for language processing that addresses tree decoration, tree transformation, dynamic semantics, and pretty-printing.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `util` package?\n   - The `util` package contains support modules for parsing, input/output, read-eval-print loops (REPLs), and pattern matching.\n\n3. What are the `==>` and `===>` type constructors used for?\n   - The `==>` type constructor is a convenient type constructor for partial functions, while the `===>` type constructor is another convenient type constructor for partial functions."
