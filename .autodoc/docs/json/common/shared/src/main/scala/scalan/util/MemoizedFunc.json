  "summary": "The `MemoizedFunc` class is designed to transform a given function into a memoized equivalent function. Memoization is a technique that involves caching the results of a function so that it can be retrieved on repeated invocations with the same argument. This can be useful in situations where the function is computationally expensive and is called frequently with the same arguments.\n\nThe `MemoizedFunc` class takes a function `f` as its input and returns a new function that is memoized. The memoization is implemented by computing the function `f` only once for each argument value and storing the computed result in a hash table. The hash table is implemented using the `AVHashMap` class, which is a custom implementation of a hash table that is optimized for performance.\n\nThe `apply` method of the `MemoizedFunc` class is used to apply the memoized function to a given argument. If the result for the argument is already present in the hash table, it is retrieved and returned. Otherwise, the function `f` is computed for the argument, and the result is stored in the hash table for future use.\n\nThe `reset` method of the `MemoizedFunc` class is used to clear the cache of memoized results. This can be useful in situations where the function `f` is updated or the arguments change, and the cached results are no longer valid.\n\nOverall, the `MemoizedFunc` class provides a simple and efficient way to memoize a function in Scala. It can be used in a variety of contexts where memoization is useful, such as in machine learning algorithms or in web applications that require frequent computations. Here is an example of how to use the `MemoizedFunc` class:\n\n```\nval memoizedFunc = new MemoizedFunc((x: Int) => {\n  // Some expensive computation\n  x * x\n})\n\nval result1 = memoizedFunc(5) // Computes result for 5\nval result2 = memoizedFunc(5) // Retrieves cached result for 5\nmemoizedFunc.reset() // Clears the cache\nval result3 = memoizedFunc(5) // Computes result for 5 again\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the AVHashMap import?\n   - The AVHashMap is used to store the computed results of the function in a hash table for memoization.\n\n2. Can the MemoizedFunc class be used with functions that have multiple arguments?\n   - No, the MemoizedFunc class only accepts functions with a single argument of type AnyRef.\n\n3. Is it possible to change the size of the hash table used for memoization?\n   - Yes, the size of the hash table can be changed by modifying the argument passed to the AVHashMap constructor."
