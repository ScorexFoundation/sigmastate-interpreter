      "summary": "The code in this file provides utility functions for working with collections in Scala. It defines a Scala object called Collections that contains several methods for converting between Java and Scala collections, as well as for building collections.\n\nThe first set of methods are for converting Java collections to Scala collections. These methods use the JavaConverters library to convert a Java collection to a Scala collection. Specifically, the javaCollectionToVector method takes a java.util.Collection and returns a Vector, which is a type of immutable sequence in Scala. This method can be useful when working with Java libraries that return collections that need to be used in Scala code.\n\nThe second method, mapToJavaMap, takes a Scala Map and returns a java.util.Map. This method can be useful when working with Java libraries that require a Java Map as input.\n\nThe third method, seqToJavaList, takes a Scala Seq and returns a java.util.List. This method can be useful when working with Java libraries that require a Java List as input.\n\nThe second set of methods are for building collections. The newBuilder method takes a Factory or CanBuildFrom object and returns a Builder object. The Factory and CanBuildFrom types are part of the Scala collections library and are used to create new collections. The newBuilder method can be used to create a new Builder object that can be used to add elements to a collection. The first version of the method takes a Factory object, which is used to create a new collection of type C. The second version of the method takes a CanBuildFrom object and an initial collection of type A, and is used to create a new collection of type C.\n\nOverall, this code provides useful utility functions for working with collections in Scala, particularly when interfacing with Java libraries.",

  "summary": "The `Collections.scala` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/common/shared/src/main/scala-2.11/sigmastate/kiama/util` folder provides utility functions for working with collections in Scala, particularly when interfacing with Java libraries. It defines a Scala object called `Collections` that contains several methods for converting between Java and Scala collections, as well as for building collections.\n\n### Converting Java collections to Scala collections\n\nThe first set of methods are for converting Java collections to Scala collections. These methods use the `JavaConverters` library to convert a Java collection to a Scala collection. For example, the `javaCollectionToVector` method takes a `java.util.Collection` and returns a `Vector`, which is a type of immutable sequence in Scala:\n\n```scala\nimport java.util.ArrayList\nimport sigmastate.kiama.util.Collections._\n\nval javaList = new ArrayList[String]()\njavaList.add(\"hello\")\njavaList.add(\"world\")\n\nval scalaVector = javaCollectionToVector(javaList)\n```\n\n### Converting Scala collections to Java collections\n\nThe second and third methods, `mapToJavaMap` and `seqToJavaList`, take a Scala `Map` and `Seq` respectively and return their Java counterparts, `java.util.Map` and `java.util.List`. These methods can be useful when working with Java libraries that require Java collections as input:\n\n```scala\nimport scala.collection.immutable.HashMap\nimport java.util.List\nimport sigmastate.kiama.util.Collections._\n\nval scalaMap = HashMap(\"one\" -> 1, \"two\" -> 2)\nval javaMap = mapToJavaMap(scalaMap)\n\nval scalaSeq = Seq(\"hello\", \"world\")\nval javaList: List[String] = seqToJavaList(scalaSeq)\n```\n\n### Building collections\n\nThe `newBuilder` method takes a `Factory` or `CanBuildFrom` object and returns a `Builder` object. The `Factory` and `CanBuildFrom` types are part of the Scala collections library and are used to create new collections. The `newBuilder` method can be used to create a new `Builder` object that can be used to add elements to a collection:\n\n```scala\nimport scala.collection.mutable.Builder\nimport scala.collection.immutable.Vector\nimport sigmastate.kiama.util.Collections._\n\nval builder: Builder[String, Vector[String]] = newBuilder(Vector)\nbuilder += \"hello\"\nbuilder += \"world\"\n\nval scalaVector = builder.result()\n```\n\nIn summary, the `Collections.scala` file provides useful utility functions for working with collections in Scala, particularly when interfacing with Java libraries. These functions can be used to convert between Java and Scala collections and to build new collections using the `Builder` object.",
