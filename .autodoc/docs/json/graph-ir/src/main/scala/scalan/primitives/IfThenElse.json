  "summary": "The code defines the IfThenElse trait which provides a way to construct an if-then-else statement with lazy evaluation of branches. The trait extends the Base trait and requires a Scalan trait to be mixed in. \n\nThe main method provided by the trait is IF, which takes a boolean condition and returns an IfBranch object. The IfBranch object provides the syntax for defining the then and else branches of the if-then-else statement. The THEN method takes a by-name parameter representing the then branch and returns a ThenIfBranch object. The ThenIfBranch object provides the syntax for defining the else branch of the if-then-else statement. The ELSE method takes a by-name parameter representing the else branch and returns a reference to the result of the if-then-else statement.\n\nThe trait also defines the IfThenElseLazy case class which represents the IR node for the if-then-else statement with lazy evaluation of branches. The case class takes a boolean condition and two Thunk objects representing the then and else branches. The Thunk objects are constructed using the Thunk method which takes a by-name parameter and returns a reference to a ThunkDef object.\n\nThe ifThenElseLazy method constructs an IfThenElseLazy object by wrapping the by-name parameters for the then and else branches in ThunkDef objects. The method returns a reference to the result of the if-then-else statement.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to construct an if-then-else statement with lazy evaluation of branches. This can be useful in situations where the evaluation of the branches is expensive or may not be necessary depending on the value of the condition. The code can be used in the larger project to provide a more efficient and flexible way to handle conditional logic. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval x = 5\nval y = 10\nval z = if (x > y) {\n  \"x is greater than y\"\n} else {\n  \"y is greater than x\"\n}\n```\n\ncan be written using the IfThenElse trait as:\n\n```\nval x = 5\nval y = 10\nval z = IF(x > y).THEN(\"x is greater than y\").ELSE(\"y is greater than x\")\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `IfThenElse` trait and how is it used in the project?\n   \n   The `IfThenElse` trait defines methods and classes for constructing if-then-else expressions with lazy evaluation of branches. It is used in the project to provide a convenient syntax for constructing such expressions.\n\n2. What is the difference between `THEN` and `ELSE` methods in the `ThenIfBranch` class?\n   \n   The `THEN` method is used to specify the \"then\" branch of the if-then-else expression, while the `ELSE` method is used to specify the \"else\" branch. The `ELSE` method returns the result of the if-then-else expression.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `IfThenElseLazy` case class and how is it used in the `ifThenElseLazy` method?\n   \n   The `IfThenElseLazy` case class represents an if-then-else expression with lazy evaluation of branches. It is used in the `ifThenElseLazy` method to construct an IR node that wraps the \"then\" and \"else\" branches in `ThunkDef` nodes, which are evaluated lazily."
