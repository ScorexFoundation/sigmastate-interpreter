  "summary": "The code defines a simple profiler to measure the average execution times of ErgoTree operations. It consists of several classes and methods to collect, store, and analyze the profile measurements.\n\n`StatHolder` is an abstract class that holds a series of profile measurements associated with a key. It provides methods to compute simple statistics like count, sum, average, and mean.\n\n`StatCollection` is a class that collects profiler measured data points associated with keys. It groups points by key into `StatHolder`s. It provides methods to get the mean value for a given key, add a data point, and map each entry of the collected mapping to a new array of values using a given function.\n\n`Profiler` is the main class that measures the execution times of ErgoTree operations. It maintains a stack of `OpStat` instances, which represent the evaluation of a node in the ErgoTree. The `onBeforeNode` and `onAfterNode` methods are called before and after the evaluation of a node, respectively. These methods update the timing stats for the operations and methods using `addOpTime` and `addMcTime`.\n\nThe `addCostItem` method is used to add the cost item and its execution time to the `costItemsStat` collection. The `addEstimation` and `addJitEstimation` methods are used to add estimated cost and actual measured time data points to the `estimationCostStat` and `measuredTimeStat` collections for a given script.\n\nThe `generateReport` method generates a report containing operation timing tables using the collected execution profile information. It sorts and formats the data into a readable string representation.\n\nIn the larger project, this profiler can be used to analyze the performance of ErgoTree operations and help optimize their execution times.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `StatHolder` and `StatCollection` classes?**\n\n   The `StatHolder` class holds a series of profile measurements associated with a key and allows computing simple statistic data. The `StatCollection` class collects profiler measured data points associated with keys, grouping points by key into `StatHolder`s.\n\n2. **How does the `Profiler` class work and what is its main functionality?**\n\n   The `Profiler` class is a simple profiler to measure average execution times of ErgoTree operations. It maintains a stack of `OpStat` objects to track the execution times of operations and provides methods like `onBeforeNode` and `onAfterNode` to be called by the evaluator during the execution of nodes. It also collects and maintains various statistics related to operation timings, method calls, and cost items.\n\n3. **How does the `generateReport` method work and what information does it provide?**\n\n   The `generateReport` method generates a report based on the collected execution profile information. It creates tables for operation timings, method calls, cost items, and estimation costs, sorting and formatting the data for better readability. The report provides information about execution times, counts, suggested costs, actual costs, and other relevant details for each operation, method call, and cost item."
