  "summary": "This code defines four custom exception classes that are used in the larger project. These exceptions are used to handle errors related to invalid binary and unary operation parameters, method not found, and non-applicable method. \n\nThe `InvalidBinaryOperationParameters` and `InvalidUnaryOperationParameters` classes are used to handle errors that occur when the parameters passed to a binary or unary operation are invalid. These exceptions are thrown when the type of the parameters is not compatible with the operation being performed. For example, if the code tries to perform a binary operation on two values of different types, an `InvalidBinaryOperationParameters` exception will be thrown.\n\nThe `MethodNotFound` class is used to handle errors that occur when a method is not found. This exception is thrown when the code tries to call a method that does not exist. For example, if the code tries to call a method that has been misspelled or does not exist in the current context, a `MethodNotFound` exception will be thrown.\n\nThe `NonApplicableMethod` class is used to handle errors that occur when a method is not applicable. This exception is thrown when the code tries to call a method with parameters that are not compatible with the method's signature. For example, if the code tries to call a method that expects an integer parameter with a string parameter, a `NonApplicableMethod` exception will be thrown.\n\nOverall, these custom exception classes are an important part of the larger project as they help to handle errors that occur during the execution of the code. By defining these custom exceptions, the code can provide more detailed error messages to the user, making it easier to identify and fix issues. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\ntry {\n  // perform a binary operation with invalid parameters\n  val result = 5 + \"hello\"\n} catch {\n  case e: InvalidBinaryOperationParameters => println(e.getMessage)\n}\n\ntry {\n  // call a non-existent method\n  val result = someObject.nonExistentMethod()\n} catch {\n  case e: MethodNotFound => println(e.getMessage)\n}\n\ntry {\n  // call a method with non-applicable parameters\n  val result = someObject.someMethod(\"hello\")\n} catch {\n  case e: NonApplicableMethod => println(e.getMessage)\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `sigmastate.exceptions` package?\n- The `sigmastate.exceptions` package contains classes that define custom exceptions related to type checking in the Sigma programming language.\n\n2. What is the parent class of the `InvalidBinaryOperationParameters`, `InvalidUnaryOperationParameters`, `MethodNotFound`, and `NonApplicableMethod` classes?\n- The parent class of these classes is `TyperException`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `source` parameter in the constructor of each of these classes?\n- The `source` parameter is an optional parameter that allows the caller to specify the source context of the exception, which can be useful for debugging purposes."
