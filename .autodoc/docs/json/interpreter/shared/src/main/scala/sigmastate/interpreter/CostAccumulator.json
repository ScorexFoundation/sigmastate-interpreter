  "summary": "The code defines two classes, `CostCounter` and `CostAccumulator`, which are used to track the cost of executing a program. \n\n`CostCounter` is a simple class that encapsulates a monotonic counter that can only be incremented. It has an initial cost value, which is set when the counter is created, and a current cost value, which is updated each time the counter is incremented. The `resetCost()` method can be used to reset the current cost value to the initial value.\n\n`CostAccumulator` is a more complex class that implements a finite state machine with a stack of graph blocks (scopes), which correspond to lambdas and thunks. It accepts messages: `startScope()`, `endScope()`, `add()`, and `reset()`. At any time, `totalCost` is the currently accumulated cost.\n\nThe `Scope` class represents a single scope during execution of the graph. When the evaluation enters a new scope (e.g. calling a lambda), a new `Scope` instance is created and pushed to the `_scopeStack`, then it starts receiving `add` method calls. When the evaluation leaves the scope, the top is popped off the stack. The `add` method is called once for each operation of a scope (lambda or thunk), and it updates the current cost of the current scope. If the current accumulated cost exceeds the `costLimit`, a `CostLimitException` is thrown.\n\nThe `reset()` method resets the accumulator into its initial state to be ready for new graph execution. The `totalCost` method returns the total accumulated cost.\n\nOverall, these classes are used to track the cost of executing a program and ensure that it does not exceed a certain limit. They can be used in the larger project to optimize the execution of the program and prevent it from consuming too many resources. For example, the `CostAccumulator` class could be used to optimize the execution of smart contracts on a blockchain by limiting their resource consumption.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CostCounter` class?\n- The `CostCounter` class encapsulates a simple monotonic counter with reset and is used to keep track of the current cost.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Scope` class?\n- The `Scope` class represents a single scope during execution of the graph and is used to accumulate costs for each operation of a scope.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CostAccumulator` class?\n- The `CostAccumulator` class implements a finite state machine with a stack of graph blocks (scopes) and is used to accumulate costs for each operation of a scope. It also checks if the accumulated cost exceeds the cost limit and throws a `CostLimitException` if it does."
