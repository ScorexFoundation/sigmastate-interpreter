  "summary": "The code above defines several exception classes that are used in the larger project. These exceptions are used to handle errors that may occur during the execution of the project. \n\nThe `SigmaException` class is the base class for all the exceptions defined in this file. It takes in a message and an optional cause, which is a Throwable object that caused the exception. This class extends the built-in `Exception` class in Scala.\n\nThe `SerializerException` class is a subclass of `SigmaException` and is used to handle errors that occur during serialization. It takes in a message and an optional cause, just like `SigmaException`.\n\nThe `InterpreterException` class is another subclass of `SigmaException` and is used to handle errors that occur during interpretation. It takes in a message and an optional cause, just like `SigmaException`.\n\nThe `CostLimitException` class is also a subclass of `SigmaException` and is used to handle errors that occur when the estimated cost of executing a program exceeds a certain limit. It takes in an estimated cost, a message, and an optional cause. The estimated cost is a long value that represents the estimated cost of executing a program, while the message is a string that describes the error. \n\nThe `CostLimitException` class also defines a companion object that contains a single method called `msgCostLimitError`. This method takes in two `JitCost` objects, `cost` and `limit`, and returns a string that describes the error. This method is used to generate error messages when a `CostLimitException` is thrown.\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of exception classes that can be used to handle errors that may occur during the execution of the larger project. These exceptions can be thrown when an error occurs, and the appropriate error message can be generated using the methods provided by these classes. For example, if the estimated cost of executing a program exceeds a certain limit, a `CostLimitException` can be thrown with an appropriate error message generated using the `msgCostLimitError` method.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SigmaException` class and its subclasses?\n- The `SigmaException` class and its subclasses (`SerializerException`, `InterpreterException`, and `CostLimitException`) are used to represent different types of exceptions that can occur in the `sigmastate` package.\n\n2. What is the `CostLimitException` class used for?\n- The `CostLimitException` class is used to represent an exception that occurs when the estimated execution cost of a program exceeds a specified limit.\n\n3. What is the `msgCostLimitError` method in the `CostLimitException` object used for?\n- The `msgCostLimitError` method in the `CostLimitException` object is used to generate an error message for a `CostLimitException` instance, given the estimated cost and the limit."
