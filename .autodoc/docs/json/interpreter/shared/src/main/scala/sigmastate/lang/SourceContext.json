  "summary": "The code in this file defines a case class and an object that provide functionality for creating and manipulating source code contexts. A source code context is a representation of the location of a piece of code within a larger source file, including the line number, column number, and the text of the line itself.\n\nThe `SourceContext` case class defines a context object with three fields: `line`, `column`, and `sourceLine`. The `line` and `column` fields represent the location of the code within the source file, while the `sourceLine` field contains the text of the line of code.\n\nThe `SourceContext` object provides two methods for creating `SourceContext` objects. The first method, `fromParserIndex`, takes an index and an input string as arguments and returns a `SourceContext` object representing the location of the code at the given index within the input string. This method works by splitting the input string into lines, scanning through the lines to determine the start and end indices of each line, and then finding the line containing the given index. If the index is not found within any line, the method returns a `SourceContext` object representing the last character of the last line.\n\nThe second method, `fromParserFailure`, takes a `Failure` object as an argument and returns a `SourceContext` object representing the location of the code that caused the failure. This method simply calls `fromParserIndex` with the index and input string from the `Failure` object.\n\nOverall, this code provides a useful tool for working with source code contexts in a larger project. For example, it could be used by a compiler or interpreter to provide more detailed error messages that include the location of the error within the source file. Here is an example of how this code could be used:\n\n```\nval input = \"val x = 42\\nval y = x + 1\\nprintln(y)\"\nval index = 10\nval context = SourceContext.fromParserIndex(index, input)\nprintln(s\"Error at line ${context.line}, column ${context.column}: ${context.sourceLine}\")\n```\n\nThis code would output: `Error at line 2, column 5: val y = x + 1`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SourceContext` case class?\n- The `SourceContext` case class is used to store information about the location of a piece of code in the source file, including the line number, column number, and the source code on that line.\n\n2. What is the `fromParserIndex` method used for?\n- The `fromParserIndex` method is used to create a `SourceContext` object based on the index of a parsed piece of code and the input source file. It calculates the line and column numbers of the parsed code and returns a `SourceContext` object with that information.\n\n3. What is the `fromParserFailure` method used for?\n- The `fromParserFailure` method is used to create a `SourceContext` object based on a parsing failure. It takes in a `Failure` object and returns a `SourceContext` object with the line and column numbers of the failed code and the source code on that line."
