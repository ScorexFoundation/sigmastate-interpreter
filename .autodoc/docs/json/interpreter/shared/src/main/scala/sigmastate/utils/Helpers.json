  "summary": "The `Helpers` object contains a set of utility functions that can be used across the project. \n\nThe `MutableCell` class is a helper class that encapsulates a mutable value. \n\nThe `xor` function takes two or more byte arrays and performs an XOR operation on them. The `xorU` function is similar to `xor`, but it performs an in-place update of the first argument. Both functions return the resulting byte array. \n\nThe `concatArrays` function concatenates two arrays into a new resulting array. All items of both arrays are copied to the result using `System.arraycopy`. \n\nThe `castArray` function casts an array of type `A` to an array of type `B`. \n\nThe `deepHashCode` function returns the hash code of an array. It is optimized for arrays of primitive types and arrays of objects. \n\nThe `safeIdHashCode` function returns the hash code of an array of bytes. It is optimized for arrays that represent some hash and have enough randomness. \n\nThe `TryOps` class provides additional methods for `Try` instances. The `fold` method takes two functions, one to handle the success case and one to handle the failure case. The `toEither` method converts a `Try` instance to an `Either` instance. The `mapOrThrow` method applies a function to the value of a `Try` instance and throws an exception if the `Try` instance is a failure. The `getOrThrow` method returns the value of a `Try` instance or throws an exception if the `Try` instance is a failure. \n\nThe `DecoderResultOps` class provides a `toTry` method that converts a `Decoder.Result` instance to a `Try` instance. \n\nThe `EitherOps` class provides a `mapRight` method that applies a function to the right value of an `Either` instance. \n\nThe `decodeGroupElement` function decodes a hex string into a byte array and then uses `SigmaDsl.decodePoint()` to construct a `GroupElement` instance. \n\nThe `decodeECPoint` function decodes a hex string into a `GroupElement` and then extracts the underlying `EcPointType` instance. \n\nThe `decodeBytes` function decodes a hex string into a collection of bytes. \n\nThe `Overloading` object contains three classes (`Overload1`, `Overload2`, and `Overload3`) and implicit values for each class. These can be used for overloading purposes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Helpers` object?\n- The `Helpers` object contains various helper functions for working with arrays, decoding hex strings, and converting between different data types.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Overloading` object?\n- The `Overloading` object defines three classes and creates implicit values for each of them. These values can be used for method overloading based on the type of the argument.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `MutableCell` class?\n- The `MutableCell` class encapsulates a mutable value, which can be useful for passing around a reference to a mutable object."
