  "summary": "The `ErgoLikeContext` class represents a script evaluation context that is passed to a prover and a verifier to execute and validate guarding propositions of input boxes of a transaction. It contains various properties such as `lastBlockUtxoRoot`, `headers`, `preHeader`, `dataBoxes`, `boxesToSpend`, `spendingTransaction`, `selfIndex`, `extension`, `validationSettings`, `costLimit`, `initCost`, and `activatedScriptVersion`. These properties are used to provide necessary information for the execution and validation of ErgoScript.\n\nThe `ErgoLikeContext` class also provides several methods to create a new context with updated fields, such as `withErgoTreeVersion`, `withCostLimit`, `withInitCost`, `withValidationSettings`, `withExtension`, and `withTransaction`. These methods are useful for updating the context during the script execution process.\n\nAdditionally, there are several case objects that represent ErgoScript operations related to the context, such as `MinerPubkey`, `Height`, `Inputs`, `Outputs`, `LastBlockUtxoRootHash`, `Self`, `Context`, and `Global`. These objects are used to evaluate specific context-related operations during the script execution.\n\nFor example, the `Height` case object evaluates to an `IntConstant` built from `Context.currentHeight`. It has a fixed cost for calling the `Context.HEIGHT` Scala method and an `opType` of `SFunc(SContext, SInt)`.\n\nOverall, the `ErgoLikeContext` class and related case objects play a crucial role in the execution and validation of ErgoScript, providing necessary information and operations for the script evaluation process.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `ErgoLikeContext` class?**\n\n   The `ErgoLikeContext` class represents a script evaluation context that is passed to a prover and a verifier to execute and validate the guarding proposition of input boxes of a transaction.\n\n2. **What are the main components of the `ErgoLikeContext` class?**\n\n   The main components of the `ErgoLikeContext` class include the last block UTXO root, headers, preHeader, dataBoxes, boxesToSpend, spendingTransaction, selfIndex, extension, validationSettings, costLimit, initCost, and activatedScriptVersion.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `withErgoTreeVersion()` method in the `ErgoLikeContext` class?**\n\n   The `withErgoTreeVersion()` method is used to create a new instance of the `ErgoLikeContext` class with an updated ErgoTree version. This is useful for implementing version-dependent operations and passing the updated version to the interpreter via the `special.sigma.Context`."
