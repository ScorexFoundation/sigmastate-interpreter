The `reference.conf` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/graph-ir/src/main/resources` folder is a crucial part of the Scalan framework, a Scala-based framework for developing domain-specific languages (DSLs). This file provides default configuration settings for the Scalan framework, which can be overridden by the `application.conf` file. It is essential for controlling various aspects of the framework, such as debugging, output verbosity, control dependencies, plugin loading, and graph generation during compilation.

For instance, the `debug` option in the configuration file enables the collection of extra debugging information, which can be helpful for developers when troubleshooting issues. To enable debug mode, you can set the `debug` option to `true` in the `application.conf` file:

```scala
scalan {
  debug = true
}
```

Another important aspect of the `reference.conf` file is the control over the amount of output generated by the framework. The `verbosity` option allows developers to set the desired level of output, making it easier to focus on relevant information during development.

The `addControlDeps` option enables the addition of control dependencies to the generated code, which can improve performance in some cases. This can be particularly useful when optimizing the performance of the generated DSL code.

The `reference.conf` file also includes settings for loading plugins and generating graphs during compilation. The `plugins.extraClassPath` option specifies the classpath for loading plugins, which can be jar files or directories separated by the `File.pathSeparator`. This allows developers to extend the functionality of the Scalan framework with custom plugins.

The `graphviz` section contains options for generating graphs, including whether to emit graphs, the format of the graphs (dot, svg, etc.), and the orientation of the graphs (portrait or landscape). Other options control the maximum label length for node labels, whether to show subgraphs as clusters, and whether to show metadata. To customize the format of generated graphs, set the `format` option to `svg`:

```scala
scalan {
  graphviz {
    format = svg
  }
}
```

In summary, the `reference.conf` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/graph-ir/src/main/resources` folder is a vital part of the Scalan framework, providing default configuration settings that can be customized in the `application.conf` file. It allows developers to enable or disable debugging, control the amount of output generated by the framework, and customize the generation of graphs during compilation.
