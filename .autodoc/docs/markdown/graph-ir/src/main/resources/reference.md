This file is a reference configuration file for Scalan, a Scala-based framework for developing domain-specific languages (DSLs). The purpose of this file is to provide default configuration settings for the Scalan framework, which can be overridden in the application.conf file. 

The file contains several configuration options, including debug mode, verbosity level, and control dependencies. The debug option enables the collection of extra debugging information, while the verbosity option controls the amount of output generated by the framework. The addControlDeps option enables the addition of control dependencies to the generated code, which can improve performance in some cases.

The file also includes settings for loading plugins and generating graphs during compilation. The plugins.extraClassPath option specifies the classpath for loading plugins, which can be jar files or directories separated by the File.pathSeparator. The graphviz section contains options for generating graphs, including whether to emit graphs, the format of the graphs (dot, svg, etc.), and the orientation of the graphs (portrait or landscape). Other options control the maximum label length for node labels, whether to show subgraphs as clusters, and whether to show metadata.

Overall, this file provides default configuration settings for the Scalan framework, which can be customized in the application.conf file. Developers can use this file to enable or disable debugging, control the amount of output generated by the framework, and customize the generation of graphs during compilation. 

Example usage:

To enable debug mode, set the debug option to true in the application.conf file:

```
scalan {
  debug = true
}
```

To customize the format of generated graphs, set the format option to svg:

```
scalan {
  graphviz {
    format = svg
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this configuration file?
   This configuration file is a reference file for Scalan and is used to put overrides into the application.conf file.

2. What is the significance of the "debug" and "verbosity" settings?
   The "debug" setting determines whether extra debugging information is collected, while the "verbosity" setting determines the level of verbosity for the debugging information.

3. What is the purpose of the "graphviz" section and its settings?
   The "graphviz" section contains settings for graphs produced during compilation, including whether graphs will be emitted, the format of the graphs, the orientation of the graphs, and various other settings related to the appearance of the graphs.
