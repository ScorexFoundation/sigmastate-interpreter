The code provided is a part of a larger project and defines a trait called `ProgramGraphs`. This trait extends another trait called `AstGraphs` and is used to represent program graphs. Program graphs are used to represent the control flow of a program and are constructed from a set of root symbols. The purpose of this code is to provide functionality for constructing and manipulating program graphs.

The `ProgramGraphs` trait defines a type called `PGraph`, which is an alias for `ProgramGraph`. It also defines two classes called `PGraphUsages` and `ProgramGraph`. The `PGraphUsages` class is a deboxed function that computes the usages of a given node in a graph. The `ProgramGraph` class is an immutable graph that is collected from `roots` following `Ref.node.deps` links. It takes in a set of root symbols and a filter function that can be used to filter out certain nodes from the graph. The `ProgramGraph` class also provides functionality for mirroring all the nodes of the graph, applying a rewriter, and performing rewriting.

The `ProgramGraphs` trait also defines an object called `ProgramGraph`. This object provides a method called `transform` that takes in a `Ref` and returns a new `Ref` that has been transformed using a `Rewriter` and a `MapTransformer`. The `transform` method uses the `ProgramGraph` class to construct a program graph from the root symbol and then applies the provided `Rewriter` and `MapTransformer` to the graph.

Overall, the `ProgramGraphs` trait provides functionality for constructing and manipulating program graphs. It can be used in the larger project to represent the control flow of a program and to perform transformations on the program graph. Below is an example of how the `ProgramGraph` object can be used to transform a `Ref`:

```
val s: Ref[Int] = ...
val rw: Rewriter = ...
val t: MapTransformer = ...
val transformedS = ProgramGraph.transform(s, rw, t)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PGraphUsages` class?
- The `PGraphUsages` class is a deboxed function that computes the usages of a given node in the reversed graph `g`.

2. What is the difference between `ProgramGraph` constructors?
- The `ProgramGraph` class has three constructors: one that takes a sequence of `Sym` roots and a `Nullable` transformer and filter node, one that takes a sequence of `Sym` roots and a `Nullable` filter node, and one that takes a single `Sym` root. The difference between them is the presence or absence of a transformer and filter node.

3. What is the purpose of the `transform` method in the `ProgramGraph` class?
- The `transform` method mirrors all the nodes of the graph using a given mirror instance and transformer, and performs rewriting using a given rewriter. It returns a new graph that is semantically equivalent to the original graph, but may not be a clone of it.
