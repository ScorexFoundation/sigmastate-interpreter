The `UniversalOps` trait defines a set of universal operations that can be applied to any type in the Scalan framework. The trait extends the `Base` trait and requires a `Scalan` instance to be mixed in. 

The first two case classes, `HashCode` and `ToString`, define the `hashCode` and `toString` operations respectively. These operations take a value of type `A` and return an `Int` and a `String` respectively. These operations are defined as `UnOp`s, which are unary operations that take a single argument.

The `SizeOf` case class represents the calculation of the size in bytes of a given value. The `value` parameter is of type `Ref[T]`, which is a reference to a value of type `T`. The `transform` method is used to transform the `SizeOf` node during the graph transformation phase. The `sizeOf` method is a convenience method that returns a `Ref[Long]` representing the size of the given value.

The `OpCost` case class represents the accumulation of the operation costs. It is used to avoid the problem of node sharing, where the cost of a node is accumulated multiple times. The `lambdaVar` parameter is the variable of the lambda in which scope this node is created. The `costedValueId` parameter is the id of the node for which this node represents cost. The `args` parameter is a sequence of costs of the arguments, which represent dependency information. The `opCost` parameter is the operation cost, which should be added to the current scope accumulated cost. The `opCost` method is a convenience method that returns a `Ref[Int]` representing the operation cost.

The `assertValueIdForOpCost` method is used to assert that the value node id is equal to `OpCost.costedValueId`.

The `Downcast` and `Upcast` case classes represent the downcasting and upcasting of values respectively. The `downcast` and `upcast` methods are convenience methods that return a `Ref[To]` representing the downcasted or upcasted value.

The `RepUniversalOps` class defines two implicit methods, `hashCodeRep` and `toStringRep`, that can be called on any `Ref[A]` to get the `hashCode` and `toString` of the value respectively.

The `Convert` case class represents the conversion of a value from one type to another. The `eFrom` parameter is the element of the original type, the `eTo` parameter is the element of the target type, the `x` parameter is the reference to the original value, and the `conv` parameter is the conversion function. The `tryConvert` method is a convenience method that tries to convert the value from the original type to the target type using the conversion function. If the original type is a subtype of the target type, the conversion is performed directly. Otherwise, a `Convert` node is created to represent the conversion.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `OpCost` case class and how is it used?
- The `OpCost` case class represents the accumulation of operation costs and is used to avoid the problem of node sharing during evaluation. It requires special handling during evaluation and is created using the `opCost` method.
2. What is the difference between `Downcast` and `Upcast` case classes?
- The `Downcast` case class is used to cast a reference to a subtype, while the `Upcast` case class is used to cast a reference to a supertype. Both are used to change the type of a reference.
3. What is the purpose of the `assertValueIdForOpCost` method?
- The `assertValueIdForOpCost` method is used to ensure that the `value` and `cost` parameters have the same node ID. It is used to check that the `cost` parameter is actually an `OpCost` node and that it corresponds to the correct `value` node.
