The code above defines a case class called `ModuleInfo` that contains information about a generated Special library module. This class is used in the generated code and is created to provide information about the module's package name, module name, and file extension. 

The `ModuleInfo` class takes three parameters: `packageName`, `moduleName`, and `extension`. The `packageName` parameter is a string that represents the name of the package that the module belongs to. The `moduleName` parameter is a string that represents the name of the module. The `extension` parameter is an optional string that represents the file extension of the module. By default, the file extension is set to ".scalan".

The `ModuleInfo` class has three methods: `name`, `getKey`, and `sourceFileName`. The `name` method returns an instance of the `SSymName` class, which is a class that represents a fully qualified name of a symbol. The `getKey` method returns the fully qualified name of the module. The `sourceFileName` method returns the file name of the module's source file.

This class is used in the generated code to provide information about the module. For example, it can be used to generate code that imports the module or to generate code that references the module's fully qualified name. 

Overall, the `ModuleInfo` class provides a convenient way to store and retrieve information about a generated Special library module.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ModuleInfo` class?
   - The `ModuleInfo` class provides information about a generated Special library module, including its package name, module name, and file extension.

2. What is the `name` property of the `ModuleInfo` class?
   - The `name` property is a `SSymName` object that represents the fully qualified name of the module, based on its package and module names.

3. What is the purpose of the `getKey` and `sourceFileName` methods in the `ModuleInfo` class?
   - The `getKey` method returns the fully qualified name of the module as a string, while the `sourceFileName` method returns the file path of the module's source file based on its package and module names.
