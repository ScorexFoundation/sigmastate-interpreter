The `NumericOps` trait defines extension methods and descriptors for numeric operations on types that implement the `ExactNumeric` and `ExactIntegral` type-classes. The purpose of this code is to provide a set of common numeric operations that can be used across the project. 

The `NumericOpsCls` class defines extension methods for `Ref[T]` where `T` is an instance of `ExactNumeric`. These methods include addition, subtraction, multiplication, unary negation, and conversion to `Int` and `Long`. These methods are implemented using descriptors defined in the trait. For example, the `+` method is implemented using the `NumericPlus` descriptor, which takes an instance of `ExactNumeric[T]` and returns an `EndoBinOp[T]` that applies the `plus` method of the `ExactNumeric` instance to its arguments. 

The `IntegralOpsCls` class defines extension methods for `Ref[T]` where `T` is an instance of `ExactIntegral`. These methods include division, modulo, and an alternative division operator `/!`. These methods are implemented using descriptors defined in the trait. For example, the `div` method is implemented using the `IntegralDivide` descriptor, which takes an instance of `ExactIntegral[T]` and returns a `DivOp[T]` that applies the `quot` method of the `ExactIntegral` instance to its arguments. 

The `numeric` and `integral` methods return instances of `ExactNumeric[T]` and `ExactIntegral[T]`, respectively, for a given type `T`. These methods are implemented using the `implicitly` keyword to retrieve the appropriate type-class instance for `T`. 

The descriptors for binary operations (`NumericPlus`, `NumericMinus`, `NumericTimes`, `IntegralDivide`, and `IntegralMod`) are defined as case classes that extend `EndoBinOp[T]` or `DivOp[T]`. These descriptors take an instance of `ExactNumeric[T]` or `ExactIntegral[T]` and return a function that applies the appropriate method of the type-class instance to its arguments. 

The `NumericNegate`, `NumericToInt`, and `NumericToLong` descriptors are defined as case classes that extend `UnOp[T, R]`. These descriptors take an instance of `ExactNumeric[T]` and return a function that applies the appropriate method of the type-class instance to its argument. 

Finally, the `isZero` and `isOne` methods are defined as inline functions that compare a given value with the zero or one of an instance of `ExactNumeric[T]`. 

Overall, this code provides a set of common numeric operations that can be used across the project, making it easier to write and maintain code that involves numeric calculations. For example, if a function needs to perform a division operation on a type that implements `ExactIntegral`, it can simply call the `div` method on a `Ref[T]` instance, rather than having to write its own division logic.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NumericOps` trait?
- The `NumericOps` trait defines extension methods for `Ref[T]` where `T` is an instance of `ExactNumeric` or `ExactIntegral` type-class, and provides descriptors for various numeric operations.

2. What is the difference between `NumericOpsCls` and `IntegralOpsCls`?
- `NumericOpsCls` defines extension methods for `Ref[T]` where `T` is an instance of `ExactNumeric` type-class, while `IntegralOpsCls` defines extension methods for `Ref[T]` where `T` is an instance of `ExactIntegral` type-class.

3. What is the purpose of the `isZero` and `isOne` methods?
- The `isZero` and `isOne` methods are utility methods that compare a given value with zero or one of the given `ExactNumeric` instance, respectively.
