The code in the `.autodoc/docs/json/graph-ir/src/main/scala/scalan/staged` folder provides functionality for working with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of nodes, representing program graphs and control flow, and performing compiler passes, graph transformations, and graph mirroring. This functionality is essential for optimizing and analyzing the graph in the larger Scalan project.

In `AstGraphs.scala`, the `AstGraphs` trait provides tools for working with DAGs in a functional programming context. It defines several classes and types, such as `AstGraph`, `GraphNode`, `Schedule`, and `ScheduleIds`, for representing and manipulating DAGs. The code also includes methods for building usage maps, flattening schedules, and checking for multiple usages of nodes in the DAG.

For example, you can create a new `AstGraph` object and manipulate its schedule:

```scala
val graph = new AstGraph(...)
val flattenedSchedule = graph.flattenSchedule
```

In `ProgramGraphs.scala`, the `ProgramGraphs` trait extends `AstGraphs` and focuses on constructing and manipulating program graphs, which represent the control flow of a program. It defines the `PGraph`, `PGraphUsages`, and `ProgramGraph` classes, as well as the `ProgramGraph` object, which provides a `transform` method for transforming a `Ref` using a `Rewriter` and a `MapTransformer`.

Here's an example of using the `ProgramGraph` object to transform a `Ref`:

```scala
val s: Ref[Int] = ...
val rw: Rewriter = ...
val t: MapTransformer = ...
val transformedS = ProgramGraph.transform(s, rw, t)
```

In `Transforming.scala`, the code provides a framework for defining and executing compiler passes on a graph of computations. It defines traits like `Pass`, `Transformer`, `Rewriter`, and `Mirror`, as well as classes like `PassConfig`, `DefaultPass`, `MapTransformer`, `PartialRewriter`, and the `NoRewriting` object. The code also includes methods like `beginPass`, `endPass`, `mirrorNode`, and `mirrorSymbols` for managing compiler passes and graph transformations.

For example, you can define a custom compiler pass and apply it to a graph:

```scala
object MyPass extends Pass {
  val name = "MyPass"
  ...
}

val graph = ...
graph.beginPass(MyPass)
val transformedGraph = graph.mirrorSymbols(...)
graph.endPass()
```

Overall, the code in this folder is essential for working with DAGs, program graphs, and compiler passes in the Scalan project. It provides a powerful set of tools for representing and manipulating complex data structures and algorithms, which can be integrated into larger projects to provide a high-level view of the structure and behavior of the code.
