This code defines a set of functions for performing arithmetic operations on values of numeric types in the Sigma programming language. The functions are defined in the `sigmastate` package and are accessible to other parts of the project.

The functions include `Plus`, `Minus`, `Multiply`, `Divide`, and `Modulo`, which perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations on values of numeric types. These functions take two arguments of the same numeric type and return a value of the same type.

In addition to these basic arithmetic operations, the code also defines `Min` and `Max` functions, which return the minimum and maximum of two values of the same numeric type.

Finally, the code defines `PlusModQ` and `MinusModQ` functions, which perform addition and subtraction operations on values of the `SBigInt` type, but with the result modulo a large prime number `Q`. These functions are used in cryptographic protocols to ensure that the result of the operation remains within a certain range.

Overall, this code provides a set of basic arithmetic operations that can be used in various parts of the Sigma project, such as in the implementation of smart contracts or cryptographic protocols. For example, the `Plus` function could be used to add two values in a smart contract, while the `PlusModQ` function could be used in a cryptographic protocol to perform secure addition of large numbers.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines several functions for performing mathematical operations on values of specific types.

2. What is the significance of the `SNumericType` and `SBigInt.type` types?
- `SNumericType` is a type parameter that constrains the input values to be of a numeric type, while `SBigInt.type` is a singleton type representing the `BigInt` type.

3. What is the role of the `CheckingSigmaBuilder` import?
- The `CheckingSigmaBuilder` import is used to provide access to the `mkPlus`, `mkMinus`, `mkMultiply`, `mkDivide`, `mkModulo`, `mkMin`, `mkMax`, `mkPlusModQ`, and `mkMinusModQ` functions, which are used to construct new values of the appropriate types.
