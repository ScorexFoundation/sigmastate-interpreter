The SigmaByteWriter class is a utility class that provides methods for writing various data types to a Writer object. It is used in the larger project to serialize SigmaState objects, which are used in the implementation of smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain.

The class takes a Writer object and an optional ConstantStore object as constructor arguments. The Writer object is used to write the serialized data, while the ConstantStore object is used to store constants that are referenced by the serialized data.

The class provides methods for writing various data types, including Byte, Boolean, Short, Int, Long, and arrays of Bytes. These methods take a value of the corresponding data type as an argument and write it to the Writer object. They also take an optional DataInfo object as an argument, which provides additional information about the data being written, such as its name and description.

The class also provides methods for writing SigmaState objects, including SType and SValue objects. These methods take a SigmaState object as an argument and use the appropriate serializer to write it to the Writer object.

Overall, the SigmaByteWriter class is an important utility class in the larger project, as it provides a convenient way to serialize SigmaState objects for use in smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and what does it do?
   
   This class is a writer for serializing Sigma values into bytes. It provides methods for writing various data types and values, including SType and SValue, and can also handle constant extraction.

2. What is the significance of the various marker types and format descriptors used in this code?
   
   The marker types and format descriptors are used to specify the format of the data being written and to ensure that the correct serialization method is used. For example, the ZigZag marker type is used to indicate that a value should be encoded using ZigZag encoding, while the UVlqFmt format descriptor is used to specify that an unsigned value should be encoded using variable-length quantity encoding.

3. How does this class handle constant extraction and what is its purpose?
   
   This class takes an optional constant extraction store as a parameter, which allows it to extract and serialize constant values separately from other values. This can improve efficiency by reducing the amount of redundant data that needs to be serialized and transmitted.
