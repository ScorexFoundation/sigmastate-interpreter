The `EmissionRules` class in the `org.ergoplatform.mining.emission` package is responsible for defining the coin emission curve for the Ergo blockchain network. The class takes in a `MonetarySettings` object as a parameter, which contains the network settings for the blockchain. 

The `coinsTotal` and `blocksTotal` values are lazily computed using a tail-recursive function `loop`. The function calculates the total number of coins issued and the total number of blocks mined on the network. 

The `issuedCoinsAfterHeight` method returns the number of coins issued at a given height on the blockchain. The method takes into account the fixed rate of 75 coins during the first 2 years and the reward reduction of 3 coins every 3 months after that. 

The `remainingCoinsAfterHeight` method returns the number of coins that have not been issued yet after a given height on the blockchain. 

The `emissionAtHeight` method returns the number of coins to be issued at a given height on the blockchain. The method takes into account the fixed rate of 75 coins during the first 2 years and the reward reduction of 3 coins every 3 months after that. 

The `minersRewardAtHeight` method returns the number of coins issued at a given height in favor of a miner. The method takes into account the fixed rate of 75 coins during the first 2 years and the reward reduction of 3 coins every 3 months after that. 

The `remainingFoundationRewardAtHeight` method returns the number of coins that should be kept in the foundation box at a given height on the blockchain. The method takes into account the fixed rate of 75 coins during the first 2 years and the reward reduction of 3 coins every 3 months after that. 

The `foundationRewardAtHeight` method returns the number of coins issued at a given height in favor of the foundation. The method takes into account the fixed rate of 75 coins during the first 2 years and the reward reduction of 3 coins every 3 months after that. 

The `CoinsInOneErgo` object is a constant that defines the number of nanoErgs (minimal non-divisible parts) in one Erg. 

Overall, the `EmissionRules` class is an important component of the Ergo blockchain network as it defines the coin emission curve and the rewards for miners and the foundation. It can be used by other components of the network to calculate the number of coins issued at a given height and to determine the remaining coins and rewards.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EmissionRules` class?
- The `EmissionRules` class defines the Ergo coin emission curve and provides methods to calculate the number of coins issued, remaining coins, and rewards for miners and the foundation at a given height.

2. What are the main properties of the Ergo coin emission curve on the mainnet?
- The main properties of the Ergo coin emission curve on the mainnet are: 1000000000 nanoErgs in one Erg, a block is coming every 2 minutes, fixed rate of 75 coins during the first 2 years, reward reduction for 3 coins every 3 months after that, 19710000 coins after the first year, and 97739925 coins total.

3. What is the purpose of the `remainingFoundationRewardAtHeight` method?
- The `remainingFoundationRewardAtHeight` method calculates the number of coins which should be kept in the foundation box at a given height, based on the network settings such as founders initial reward, one epoch reduction, epoch length, and fixed rate period.
