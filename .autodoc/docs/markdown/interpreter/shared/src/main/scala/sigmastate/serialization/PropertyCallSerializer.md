The `PropertyCallSerializer` class is responsible for serializing and deserializing `PropertyCall` objects in the `sigmastate` package. A `PropertyCall` is a type of `MethodCall` that represents a call to a property of an object. 

The `PropertyCallSerializer` class extends the `ValueSerializer` class and overrides its methods to provide serialization and deserialization functionality for `PropertyCall` objects. The `serialize` method takes a `MethodCall` object and a `SigmaByteWriter` object as input and writes the serialized data to the `SigmaByteWriter`. The `parse` method takes a `SigmaByteReader` object as input and reads the serialized data from it to create a `PropertyCall` object.

The `PropertyCallSerializer` class has a constructor that takes a function as input. This function is used to create a `Value` object from the deserialized data. The `cons` function takes four arguments: a `Value` object representing the receiver object of the property call, an `SMethod` object representing the method being called, a sequence of `Value` objects representing the arguments to the method call, and an `STypeSubst` object representing the type substitutions for the method call.

The `PropertyCallSerializer` class also defines three `DataInfo` objects that provide information about the serialized data. The `typeCodeInfo` object represents the type of the method being called, the `methodCodeInfo` object represents the code of the property being called, and the `objInfo` object represents the receiver object of the property call.

The `PropertyCallSerializer` class is used in the larger project to serialize and deserialize `PropertyCall` objects. For example, if the project needs to store `PropertyCall` objects in a database or send them over a network, the `PropertyCallSerializer` class can be used to serialize the objects into a byte stream and deserialize them back into `PropertyCall` objects. 

Here is an example of how the `PropertyCallSerializer` class can be used to serialize and deserialize a `PropertyCall` object:

```
val propertyCall = PropertyCall(receiverObject, method, arguments)
val serializer = PropertyCallSerializer(consFunction)
val writer = new SigmaByteWriter()
serializer.serialize(propertyCall, writer)
val bytes = writer.toBytes()

// Deserialize the bytes back into a PropertyCall object
val reader = new SigmaByteReader(bytes)
val deserializedPropertyCall = serializer.parse(reader)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains a serializer for a property call in the Sigma state language.

2. What is the significance of the `getComplexity` method?
- The `getComplexity` method returns the complexity of the property call, which is used in the `parse` method to add complexity to the `SigmaByteReader`.

3. What is the `cons` parameter in the `PropertyCallSerializer` case class?
- The `cons` parameter is a function that constructs a `Value[SType]` object from a receiver object, a specialized method, a sequence of values, and a substitution.
