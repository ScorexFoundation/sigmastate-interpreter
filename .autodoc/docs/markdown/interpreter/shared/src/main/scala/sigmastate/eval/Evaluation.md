The Evaluation object in the sigmastate.eval package provides helper methods for evaluating ErgoScript expressions in the Sigma protocol. The object contains several methods that are used to convert between ErgoTree serializable type descriptors and the corresponding RType descriptors of SigmaDsl, which is used during evaluation. 

The stypeToRType method takes an SType object and returns the corresponding RType descriptor of SigmaDsl. The method uses pattern matching to match the SType object with the corresponding RType descriptor. The method also optimizes the conversion process using memoization. 

The rtypeToSType method takes an RType descriptor of SigmaDsl and returns the corresponding serializable ErgoTree type descriptor. The method uses pattern matching to match the RType descriptor with the corresponding ErgoTree type descriptor. The method also optimizes the conversion process using memoization. 

The rtypeOf method tries to reconstruct the RType of a given value. If successful, it returns the RType descriptor. The method uses pattern matching to match the value with the corresponding RType descriptor. 

The fromDslTuple method converts SigmaDsl representation of a tuple to ErgoTree serializable representation. The method takes a value and a tuple type descriptor and returns a collection of values. 

The toDslTuple method converts ErgoTree serializable representation of a tuple to SigmaDsl representation. The method takes a collection of values and a tuple type descriptor and returns a tuple. 

Overall, the Evaluation object provides essential helper methods for evaluating ErgoScript expressions in the Sigma protocol. The object is used extensively in the larger project to convert between ErgoTree serializable type descriptors and the corresponding RType descriptors of SigmaDsl.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Evaluation` object?
- The `Evaluation` object provides helper methods for evaluating ErgoScript expressions.

2. What is the `addCostChecked` method used for?
- The `addCostChecked` method is used to accumulate cost while checking if the total cost exceeds a given limit. If the new cost exceeds the limit, a `CostLimitException` is thrown.

3. What is the purpose of the `rtypeOf` method?
- The `rtypeOf` method tries to reconstruct the `RType` of a given value. If successful, it returns the `RType`. If not, it returns a failure.
