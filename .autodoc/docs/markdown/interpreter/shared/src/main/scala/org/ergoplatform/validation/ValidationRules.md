The code defines a set of validation rules for the ErgoScript language, which is used in the Ergo Platform blockchain project. These rules are used to check the correctness of ErgoScript code during deserialization and execution. The rules can be updated via soft-forks, allowing the blockchain to evolve without breaking consensus.

The `ValidationRule` class is the base class for all validation rules. Each rule has an `id` and a `description`. The actual validation logic is implemented in the `apply` methods of derived classes. The `checkRule` method ensures that the rule is registered and enabled, and is executed only once for each rule.

The `ValidationException` class is used to communicate soft-fork information when a validation rule fails. It contains the failed rule, the arguments that caused the failure, and an optional cause (another exception).

The `ValidationRules` object contains a collection of predefined validation rules, such as `CheckDeserializedScriptType`, `CheckDeserializedScriptIsSigmaProp`, `CheckValidOpCode`, and others. These rules are used to check various aspects of ErgoScript code, such as type correctness, opcode validity, and method availability.

The `trySoftForkable` method is used to execute a block of code that may throw a `ValidationException`. If a soft-fork condition is detected, the `whenSoftFork` block is executed, otherwise, the exception is rethrown.

In the larger project, these validation rules are used during ErgoScript deserialization and execution to ensure the correctness and safety of the code. For example, when deserializing an ErgoScript, the `CheckDeserializedScriptType` rule can be used to ensure that the deserialized script has the expected type:

```scala
ValidationRules.CheckDeserializedScriptType(d, script)
```

This helps maintain the integrity of the Ergo Platform blockchain by enforcing a set of rules that all ErgoScript code must adhere to.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ValidationRule` class and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `ValidationRule` class is a base class for different validation rules registered in `ValidationRules.currentSettings`. Each rule is identified by an `id` and has a description. The validation logic is implemented by the `apply` methods of derived classes. It is used to check soft-forkable conditions and throw `ValidationException` when a rule is violated.

2. **Question**: How does the `trySoftForkable` function work and when should it be used?
   **Answer**: The `trySoftForkable` function is used to execute a block of code that may throw a `ValidationException`. It takes a `whenSoftFork` parameter, which is executed when a soft-fork condition is detected. If the soft-fork condition is not recognized by the given `SigmaValidationSettings`, the `ValidationException` is thrown. This function should be used when checking for possible soft-fork conditions in the context of the given `SigmaValidationSettings`.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `CheckPositionLimit` validation rule and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `CheckPositionLimit` validation rule is used to check that the reader has not exceeded the position limit during deserialization. It throws a `ValidationException` with the given parameters if the position is greater than the position limit. This rule can be replaced with a new rule and the limit can be increased, allowing for soft-fork conditions to be checked.
