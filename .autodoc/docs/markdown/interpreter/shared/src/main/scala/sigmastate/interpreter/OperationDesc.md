The code defines a set of classes and traits that describe the cost of operations in the Ergo blockchain. The `OperationDesc` trait is an abstract class that defines the `operationName` method, which returns the name of the operation. There are three concrete classes that extend `OperationDesc`: `CompanionDesc`, `MethodDesc`, and `NamedDesc`. 

`CompanionDesc` is a case class that takes a `ValueCompanion` as a parameter and returns the `typeName` of the companion object as the `operationName`. `ValueCompanion` is a trait that defines methods for creating and parsing values of a specific type. 

`MethodDesc` is a case class that takes an `SMethod` as a parameter and returns the `opName` of the method as the `operationName`. `SMethod` is a class that represents an operation as a method. 

`NamedDesc` is a case class that takes a `String` as a parameter and returns the same `String` as the `operationName`. This is used for intermediate sub-operations that are present in the cost model but are not separate operations in the ErgoTree.

`OperationCostInfo` is a case class that combines a `CostKind` and an `OperationDesc`. `CostKind` is a trait that defines the cost of an operation. 

Overall, this code provides a way to describe the cost of operations in the Ergo blockchain. It can be used in the larger project to optimize the execution of transactions by estimating the cost of each operation and minimizing the total cost. For example, a developer could use the `MethodDesc` class to estimate the cost of a specific method and optimize the code accordingly. 

Example usage:

```
val method = SMethod("add", Seq(IntConstant(1), IntConstant(2)))
val methodDesc = MethodDesc(method)
val costInfo = OperationCostInfo(ComputationalCost, methodDesc)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `OperationDesc` abstract class?
   
   `OperationDesc` is an abstract class that defines the common interface for operation descriptors. It provides a method `operationName` that returns the name of the operation.

2. What are the different ways in which a costable operation can be described?
   
   A costable operation can be described in one of the following ways: (1) using `ValueCompanion`, (2) using `SMethod`, or (3) using a string name.

3. What is the purpose of the `OperationCostInfo` case class?
   
   `OperationCostInfo` is a case class that combines an operation descriptor (`opDesc`) with a cost kind (`costKind`). It is used to represent the cost information for a costable operation.
