This code is part of the SigmaState language implementation and provides a set of predefined functions that can be used in ErgoScript, a language for writing smart contracts on the Ergo platform. These functions are organized into global, infix, unary, and special functions, and are used to perform various operations such as logical, arithmetic, and bitwise operations, as well as working with collections, authenticated dictionaries (AVL trees), and cryptographic primitives.

For example, the `AllOfFunc` function checks if all elements in a collection are true, while the `Blake2b256Func` function calculates the Blake2b hash of a given input byte array. These predefined functions are organized in a `PredefinedFuncRegistry` class, which maps function names to their corresponding implementations and metadata.

The code also provides a way to create and manipulate ErgoTree nodes, which represent the structure of a smart contract. This is done through the `IrBuilderFunc` type, which is a partial function that takes an `SValue` and a sequence of `SValue`s as input and returns an `SValue`. The `PredefFuncInfo` case class holds the metadata for a predefined function, including its `IrBuilderFunc`.

Here's an example of using a predefined function in ErgoScript:

```
{
  val conditions = Coll(
    OUTPUTS.exists { (outBox: Box) => outBox.value >= 1000 },
    HEIGHT > 5000
  )
  allOf(conditions)
}
```

In this example, the `allOf` function is used to check if all conditions in the `conditions` collection are true. If they are, the script evaluates to true, and the transaction is considered valid.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SigmaPredef` object and its related classes and functions?
   **Answer**: The `SigmaPredef` object contains the definitions and metadata for predefined functions in the Sigma language. It provides a registry of global, infix, unary, and special functions, along with their corresponding IR builders, which are used to generate the intermediate representation of the code during compilation.

2. **Question**: How are the predefined functions organized and categorized within the `SigmaPredef` object?
   **Answer**: Predefined functions are organized into several categories: global functions, infix functions, unary functions, and special functions. Each category is represented as a separate map within the `PredefinedFuncRegistry` class, and the functions are stored as instances of the `PredefinedFunc` case class.

3. **Question**: How can a developer add a new predefined function to the `SigmaPredef` object?
   **Answer**: To add a new predefined function, a developer needs to create a new instance of the `PredefinedFunc` case class with the appropriate metadata, such as the function name, declaration, IR builder, and documentation. Then, the new function should be added to the corresponding map (global, infix, unary, or special) within the `PredefinedFuncRegistry` class.
