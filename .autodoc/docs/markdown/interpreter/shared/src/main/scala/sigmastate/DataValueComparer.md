The `DataValueComparer` object in the given code provides an implementation for comparing two arbitrary ErgoTree data types for equality. It focuses on the high-level purpose of the code and how it may be used in the larger project. The comparison is performed recursively, descending on the value structure regardless of the depth. However, every step costs are accrued to `E.coster`, and the defined limit `E.coster.costLimit` is checked. Thus, the execution of this method is limited and always finishes at least as fast as the costLimit prescribes.

The `equalDataValues` method is the main function for comparing two data values. It dispatches on the type of the left value and then performs the specific comparison. The method handles various data types, such as numbers, booleans, collections, tuples, group elements, big integers, sigma properties, AVL trees, options, pre-headers, headers, and boxes.

For example, when comparing two collections, the `equalColls_Dispatch` method is called, which dispatches to the most efficient implementation depending on the actual type `A`. Similarly, when comparing two SigmaBoolean trees, the `equalSigmaBoolean` method is called.

The code also defines various cost constants for different types of comparisons, which are part of the consensus protocol and cannot be changed without forking. These constants are used to calculate the cost of each comparison operation, ensuring that the comparison process is efficient and adheres to the protocol's cost limits.

Overall, the `DataValueComparer` object provides a comprehensive and efficient way to compare ErgoTree data types, which is essential for various operations in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `DataValueComparer` object and its methods?
   **Answer**: The `DataValueComparer` object provides an implementation for comparing two arbitrary ErgoTree data types for equality. It contains various methods for comparing different data types, such as collections, tuples, group elements, big integers, etc., and takes into account the cost of each comparison operation.

2. **Question**: How does the cost of comparison operations affect the execution of the code?
   **Answer**: The cost of comparison operations is used to limit the execution time and resources consumed by the code. The ErgoTreeEvaluator keeps track of the accrued costs during the execution, and if the cost limit is reached, the execution is stopped. This ensures that the code execution is always within the defined limits and prevents potential denial-of-service attacks.

3. **Question**: How does the `equalDataValues` method handle different data types and their comparisons?
   **Answer**: The `equalDataValues` method uses pattern matching to dispatch the comparison based on the type of the left value. It then performs the specific comparison for that data type, recursively descending on the value structure. The method also keeps track of the cost of each comparison step and checks against the defined cost limit to ensure the execution stays within the allowed bounds.
