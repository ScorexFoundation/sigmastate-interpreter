The code provided is a set of exception classes that are used in the Sigma programming language compiler. The Sigma programming language is used to write smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain. The purpose of these exception classes is to provide detailed error messages to the user when an error occurs during the compilation process. 

The `CompilerException` class is the base class for all the other exception classes. It takes in a message, an optional `SourceContext` object, and an optional `Throwable` object. The `SourceContext` object is used to provide information about the location of the error in the source code. The `getMessage` method is overridden to provide a more detailed error message that includes the line number and column where the error occurred.

The `BinderException`, `TyperException`, `BuilderException`, and `CosterException` classes are all subclasses of `CompilerException`. They are used to represent specific types of errors that can occur during the compilation process. The `BinderException` class is used to represent errors that occur during the binding phase of compilation. The `TyperException` class is used to represent errors that occur during the type checking phase of compilation. The `BuilderException` class is used to represent errors that occur during the construction phase of compilation. The `CosterException` class is used to represent errors that occur during the cost estimation phase of compilation.

Overall, these exception classes are an important part of the Sigma programming language compiler. They provide detailed error messages to the user, which can help them identify and fix errors in their code. Here is an example of how these exception classes might be used in the larger project:

```
try {
  // code that compiles Sigma smart contract
} catch {
  case e: BinderException => println("Error during binding phase: " + e.getMessage)
  case e: TyperException => println("Error during type checking phase: " + e.getMessage)
  case e: BuilderException => println("Error during construction phase: " + e.getMessage)
  case e: CosterException => println("Error during cost estimation phase: " + e.getMessage)
  case e: CompilerException => println("Error during compilation: " + e.getMessage)
}
```

In this example, the code that compiles the Sigma smart contract is wrapped in a try-catch block. If an exception is thrown during the compilation process, the appropriate exception class is caught and a detailed error message is printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompilerException` class?
    
    The `CompilerException` class is a custom exception class that extends `SigmaException` and is used to handle exceptions that occur during the compilation process of the Sigma programming language. It takes a message, an optional source context, and an optional cause as parameters.

2. What are the differences between the `BinderException`, `TyperException`, and `BuilderException` classes?

    The `BinderException`, `TyperException`, and `BuilderException` classes are all custom exception classes that extend `CompilerException`. They are used to handle exceptions that occur during the binding, typing, and building phases of the compilation process, respectively. Each class takes a message and an optional source context as parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `CosterException` class?

    The `CosterException` class is a custom exception class that extends `CompilerException` and is used to handle exceptions that occur during the cost estimation phase of the compilation process. It takes a message, an optional source context, and an optional cause as parameters.
