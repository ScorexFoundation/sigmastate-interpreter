The `ProverUtils` trait is a collection of utility methods for generating commitments and extracting partial proofs of secret knowledge for use in distributed signature applications. The trait extends the `Interpreter` trait, which provides methods for evaluating ErgoScript expressions.

The `generateCommitmentsFor` method takes an `ErgoTree` and a `CTX` (context) and generates commitments for all the public keys provided. The method first reduces the given tree to a crypto-tree (sigma-tree) using the provided context. Then, it generates commitments for the public keys using the `generateCommitmentsFor` method that takes a `SigmaBoolean` and a sequence of `SigmaBoolean` public keys. Currently, only keys in the form of `ProveDlog` and `ProveDiffieHellman` are supported, not more complex subtrees.

The `generateCommitmentsFor` method that takes a `SigmaBoolean` and a sequence of `SigmaBoolean` public keys generates commitments (private, containing secret randomness, and public, containing only commitments) for all the public keys provided. The method traverses the sigma-tree and generates commitments for the public keys that match the keys in the `generateFor` sequence. The method uses the `DLogInteractiveProver` and `DiffieHellmanTupleInteractiveProver` classes to generate commitments for `ProveDlog` and `ProveDHTuple` public keys, respectively.

The `bagForMultisig` method extracts partial proofs of secret knowledge for particular secrets with their respective public images given. The method takes a `CTX`, an `ErgoTree`, a signature for the key, and sequences of `SigmaBoolean` public keys for real and simulated proofs. The method first reduces the given tree to a crypto-tree (sigma-tree) using the provided context. Then, it generates a proof tree using the `computeCommitments` method and the `SigSerializer` class. Finally, the method traverses the proof tree and extracts partial proofs of secret knowledge for the public keys that match the keys in the `realSecretsToExtract` and `simulatedSecretsToExtract` sequences. The method uses the `RealCommitment`, `RealSecretProof`, `SimulatedCommitment`, and `SimulatedSecretProof` classes to generate the partial proofs.

Overall, the `ProverUtils` trait provides utility methods for generating commitments and extracting partial proofs of secret knowledge for use in distributed signature applications. These methods are used in the larger project to enable secure and efficient multi-party signing of transactions on the Ergo blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ProverUtils` trait?
- The `ProverUtils` trait provides utility methods for generating commitments and extracting partial proofs of secret knowledge for distributed signature applications.

2. What types of public keys are currently supported by the `generateCommitmentsFor` method?
- The `generateCommitmentsFor` method currently supports keys in the form of `ProveDlog` and `ProveDiffieHellman`, but not more complex subtrees.

3. What is the input and output of the `bagForMultisig` method?
- The `bagForMultisig` method takes in a context, a proposition to reduce, a proof for the reduced proposition, and public keys of secrets with real and simulated proofs. It returns a bag of `OtherSecretProven` and `OtherCommitment` hints.
