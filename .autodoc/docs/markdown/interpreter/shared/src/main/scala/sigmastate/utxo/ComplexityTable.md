The `ComplexityTable` object in the `sigmastate.utxo` package is used to store the complexity values of various operations and method calls in the ErgoScript language. These complexity values are used to estimate the computational cost of executing a given ErgoScript, which is important for ensuring that scripts do not consume excessive resources during execution.

The `ComplexityTable` object contains two maps: `OpCodeComplexity` and `MethodCallComplexity`. The `OpCodeComplexity` map stores the complexity values for various operations, such as arithmetic, logical, and collection operations. The keys in this map are the operation codes (`OpCode`), and the values are the corresponding complexity values. The `MethodCallComplexity` map stores the complexity values for method calls on specific types, such as `AvlTree`, `SCollection`, and `Context`. The keys in this map are tuples of two bytes, where the first byte represents the type identifier and the second byte represents the method identifier. The values are the corresponding complexity values.

For example, the complexity of the `Fold` operation is 4034, and the complexity of the `AvlTree.update` method call is 3911. These values are used by the ErgoScript interpreter to estimate the total complexity of a given script, which can then be used to determine if the script is within acceptable resource limits for execution.

Here's an example of how the complexity values might be used:

```scala
val scriptComplexity = script.operations.map(op => ComplexityTable.OpCodeComplexity(op.opCode)).sum +
                       script.methodCalls.map(mc => ComplexityTable.MethodCallComplexity((mc.typeId, mc.methodId))).sum
if (scriptComplexity > maxAllowedComplexity) {
  // Reject the script as too complex
} else {
  // Execute the script
}
```

In this example, the complexity values for all operations and method calls in the script are summed up, and the total complexity is compared against a predefined maximum allowed complexity. If the script's complexity exceeds the maximum, it is rejected; otherwise, it is executed.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ComplexityTable` object in this code?
   **Answer**: The `ComplexityTable` object contains two maps, `OpCodeComplexity` and `MethodCallComplexity`, which store the complexity values for various opcodes and method calls used in the project. These values can be used to estimate the computational complexity of certain operations in the code.

2. **Question**: How are the complexity values in the `OpCodeComplexity` and `MethodCallComplexity` maps determined?
   **Answer**: The complexity values in the maps are hard-coded and seem to be based on some pre-determined analysis or benchmarking of the operations. The comments next to each entry indicate the count of occurrences for each operation, which might have been used to calculate the complexity values.

3. **Question**: What is the significance of the `MinimalComplexity` constant in the code?
   **Answer**: The `MinimalComplexity` constant is set to 100 and represents the minimum complexity value that can be assigned to an operation. This can be used as a baseline for comparing the complexity of different operations in the code.
