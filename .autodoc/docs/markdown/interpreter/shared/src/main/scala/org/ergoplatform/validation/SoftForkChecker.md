This code defines three traits that are used to check for soft-fork conditions in the Ergo blockchain protocol. A soft-fork is a change in the protocol that is backward-compatible, meaning that nodes that have not upgraded to the new version can still validate transactions and blocks created by nodes that have upgraded. 

The `SoftForkChecker` trait defines an interface that must be implemented by objects that can check for soft-fork conditions. It has one method, `isSoftFork`, which takes four parameters: `vs`, `ruleId`, `status`, and `args`. `vs` is an object of type `SigmaValidationSettings` that contains validation settings actualized from blockchain extension sections. `ruleId` is an identifier for the validation rule that raised a `ValidationException`. `status` is the status of the rule in the blockchain, which is agreed upon via voting. `args` are the arguments of the validation rule with which the rule has raised the exception. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether `args` and `status` can be interpreted as a valid soft-fork condition. 

The `SoftForkWhenReplaced` trait extends `SoftForkChecker` and checks for a specific type of soft-fork condition. It checks that the failed validation rule has a `ReplacedRule` status in the block extensions section. This means that the rule given by `ruleId` is not used in newer versions of the protocol and has been replaced by a new rule given by the `ReplacedRule` status. 

The `SoftForkWhenCodeAdded` trait also extends `SoftForkChecker` and checks for another type of soft-fork condition. It checks that an unknown `code` is present in the `ChangedRule` new value stored in the block extensions section. This is interpreted as a soft-fork condition, meaning that the unknown `code` is not arbitrary but explicitly added to the blockchain configuration and implemented in newer versions of the protocol. 

Overall, these traits are used to check for soft-fork conditions in the Ergo blockchain protocol. They can be used by other parts of the project to ensure that nodes can still validate transactions and blocks even if they have not upgraded to the latest version of the protocol. Here is an example of how the `SoftForkWhenReplaced` trait can be used:

```
val checker: SoftForkChecker = new SoftForkWhenReplaced()
val isSoftFork = checker.isSoftFork(vs, ruleId, status, args)
if (isSoftFork) {
  // handle soft-fork condition
} else {
  // continue with normal validation
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the SoftForkChecker trait?
   - The SoftForkChecker trait is an interface implemented by objects capable of checking soft-fork conditions.

2. What is the difference between SoftForkWhenReplaced and SoftForkWhenCodeAdded traits?
   - SoftForkWhenReplaced checks if the failed validation rule has ReplacedRule status in block extensions section, while SoftForkWhenCodeAdded checks if the unknown `code` is present in the ChangedRule new value stored in block extensions section.

3. What is the input and output of the isSoftFork method?
   - The input of the isSoftFork method includes ValidationSettings, ruleId, status, and args. The output is a boolean value indicating whether `args` and `status` can be interpreted as a valid soft-fork condition.
