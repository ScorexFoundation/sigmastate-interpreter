This code provides default implementations for various interfaces used in the Sigma-State language, which is the core language for Ergo smart contracts. The main purpose of this code is to provide a way to work with Sigma-State values and operations in a more user-friendly manner, by wrapping them in higher-level abstractions.

The main classes and traits implemented in this code are:

- `WrapperOf[T]`: A trait for wrapper classes that provide access to the underlying wrapped value of type `T`.
- `CBigInt`: A default implementation of the `BigInt` interface, wrapping a `BigInteger` value.
- `CGroupElement`: A default implementation of the `GroupElement` interface, wrapping an `Ecp` value (elliptic curve point).
- `CSigmaProp`: A default implementation of the `SigmaProp` interface, wrapping a `SigmaBoolean` value.
- `CAvlTreeVerifier`: An implementation of the `AvlTreeVerifier` trait based on `BatchAVLVerifier`.
- `CAvlTree`: A default implementation of the `AvlTree` interface, wrapping an `AvlTreeData` value.
- `CAnyValue`: A default implementation of the `AnyValue` interface, wrapping a value of any type `A`.
- `CostingBox`: A default implementation of the `Box` interface, wrapping an `ErgoBox` value.
- `CPreHeader`: A default implementation of the `PreHeader` interface.
- `CHeader`: A default implementation of the `Header` interface.
- `CostingSigmaDslBuilder`: A default implementation of the `SigmaDslBuilder` interface, providing methods for constructing Sigma-State values and operations.
- `CostingDataContext`: A default implementation of the `Context` interface, providing access to various context data and methods.

These implementations are used in the larger project to work with Sigma-State values and operations in a more user-friendly and efficient way. For example, the `CBigInt` class provides methods for arithmetic operations on big integers, while the `CGroupElement` class provides methods for working with elliptic curve points. The `CostingSigmaDslBuilder` class provides a way to construct Sigma-State values and operations, and the `CostingDataContext` class provides access to various context data and methods.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `WrapperOf[T]` trait?
   **Answer**: The `WrapperOf[T]` trait is an interface implemented by wrapper classes to provide access to the underlying wrapped value of type `T`. It has a single method `wrappedValue` which returns the data value wrapped by the implementing class.

2. **Question**: How does the `CBigInt` class handle arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication?
   **Answer**: The `CBigInt` class handles arithmetic operations by calling the corresponding methods on the wrapped `BigInteger` value and then wrapping the result back into a `CBigInt` instance. For example, in the `add` method, it calls `wrappedValue.add(...)` and then wraps the result using `dsl.BigInt(...)`. It also ensures that the result is a 256-bit value using the `to256BitValueExact` method.

3. **Question**: How does the `CAvlTree` class handle tree operations like insert, update, and remove?
   **Answer**: The `CAvlTree` class handles tree operations by creating a `CAvlTreeVerifier` instance with the current tree data and then performing the corresponding operation using the `BatchAVLVerifier` methods. For example, in the `insert` method, it calls `bv.performOneOperation(Insert(...))` for each entry to be inserted. After all operations are performed, it updates the tree digest if the operation was successful.
