The code defines the `ErgoAddress` trait and its implementations for different types of Ergo addresses: `P2PKAddress`, `Pay2SHAddress`, and `Pay2SAddress`. Ergo addresses are short strings that correspond to scripts used to protect a box. They have useful characteristics such as integrity checking, network and address type indication, and Base58 encoding to avoid similar-looking characters.

The `ErgoAddress` trait has three main properties: `addressTypePrefix`, `contentBytes`, and `script`. The `addressTypePrefix` is a byte that differentiates between pay-to-public-key, pay-to-script, and pay-to-script-hash addresses. The `contentBytes` is an array of bytes representing the address content, and the `script` is an `ErgoTree` that corresponds to the address.

The `P2PKAddress` class represents a pay-to-public-key address, which uses a serialized (compressed) public key as its content bytes. The `Pay2SHAddress` class represents a pay-to-script-hash address, which uses the first 192 bits of the Blake2b256 hash of the serialized script bytes as its content bytes. The `Pay2SAddress` class represents a pay-to-script address, which uses the serialized script as its content bytes.

The `ErgoAddressEncoder` case class provides methods for converting Ergo addresses to and from Base58 strings. It takes a `networkPrefix` parameter to differentiate between mainnet and testnet addresses. The `toString` method converts an `ErgoAddress` to a Base58 string, while the `fromString` method converts a Base58 string to an `ErgoAddress`. The `fromProposition` method converts an `ErgoTree` to the corresponding `ErgoAddress`.

Example usage:

```scala
implicit val encoder: ErgoAddressEncoder = ErgoAddressEncoder(ErgoAddressEncoder.MainnetNetworkPrefix)

val p2pkAddress = P2PKAddress(pubkey)
val p2shAddress = Pay2SHAddress(script)
val p2sAddress = Pay2SAddress(script)

val p2pkStr = encoder.toString(p2pkAddress)
val p2shStr = encoder.toString(p2shAddress)
val p2sStr = encoder.toString(p2sAddress)

val decodedP2pk = encoder.fromString(p2pkStr)
val decodedP2sh = encoder.fromString(p2shStr)
val decodedP2s = encoder.fromString(p2sStr)
```

This code is essential for handling Ergo addresses in the larger project, as it provides a way to create, encode, and decode addresses for different types of scripts and network configurations.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What are the different address types supported by this code and their semantics?
   **Answer**: The code supports three address types: Pay-to-PublicKey (P2PK), Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH), and Pay-to-Script (P2S). P2PK addresses correspond to a serialized (compressed) public key, P2SH addresses use the first 192 bits of the Blake2b256 hash of serialized script bytes, and P2S addresses use the serialized script.

2. **Question**: How does the code ensure the integrity of an address?
   **Answer**: The integrity of an address is ensured by incorporating a checksum. The checksum is calculated using the Blake2b256 hash function on the prefix byte and content bytes of the address.

3. **Question**: What are the possible network types and their corresponding prefix values?
   **Answer**: There are two possible network types: Mainnet and Testnet. Mainnet has a prefix value of 0x00, and Testnet has a prefix value of 0x10.
