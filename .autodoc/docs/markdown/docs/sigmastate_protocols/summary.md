The `compile.sh` script in the `.autodoc/docs/json/docs/sigmastate_protocols` folder is responsible for compiling a LaTeX document named "sigmastate_protocols" into a PDF file. This script is essential for generating PDFs from LaTeX source files, which can be particularly useful for projects that include technical documentation written in LaTeX.

The script starts by checking if the required commands "pdflatex" and "bibtex" are installed on the system using the "command -v" command. If either of these commands is not found, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.

If both commands are found, the script proceeds to run "pdflatex" on the LaTeX document, followed by "bibtex" to process any bibliographic references. To ensure that all references and cross-references are resolved correctly, the "pdflatex" command is run three more times. Finally, the script removes some auxiliary files generated during the compilation process.

This script can be integrated into a larger project as part of a build process to automatically generate PDFs from LaTeX source files. For instance, a software project that includes technical documentation written in LaTeX could use this script to generate PDFs that can be distributed to users.

Here's an example of how this script could be used in a larger project:

```bash
# Compile all LaTeX documents in the project
for file in *.tex; do
    sh compile_latex.sh "$file"
done
```

In this example, the script is called for each LaTeX file in the project directory, and the name of the file is passed as an argument to the script. This allows the script to be used for multiple documents without having to modify the script itself.

In summary, the `compile.sh` script in the `.autodoc/docs/json/docs/sigmastate_protocols` folder is a useful tool for compiling LaTeX documents into PDF files. It can be integrated into a larger project to automate the generation of PDFs from LaTeX source files, making it an essential component for projects that include technical documentation written in LaTeX.
