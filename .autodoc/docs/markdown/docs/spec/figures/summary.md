The `.autodoc/docs/json/docs/spec/figures` folder contains three files that define the syntax, semantics, and typing rules for a programming language called \langname. These files are essential for understanding the structure and behavior of the language, and they can be used to implement interpreters, compilers, and development tools for the language.

1. **fig_language.tex**: This file provides a syntax definition for \langname, including types, terms, and method signatures. Developers can use this syntax to write code in the language. For example, to define a variable of type "collection of integers", one can use the syntax `\lst{Coll}[Int]`.

2. **fig_semantics.tex**: This file defines the reduction contexts and call-by-value evaluation relation for \langname. It specifies how expressions are evaluated in the language using reduction rules. For instance, to evaluate the expression `(\Lam{x}{x+1})~2`, rule (1) can be applied to get `[[2/x](x+1)]`, which reduces to `3`.

3. **fig_typing.tex**: This file contains inference rules for a type system, which define how to derive the type of an expression in a given context. These rules are used to statically type check expressions and can help catch errors early in the development process. For example, if `f(x: Int, y: String) = x + y.length`, then `f` has type `(Int, String) -> Int`.

Here's an example of how these files might be used together in a larger project:

```python
# Define a function using the syntax from fig_language.tex
func_def = "f(x: Int, y: String) = x + y.length"

# Check the typing of the function using the rules from fig_typing.tex
func_type = infer_type(func_def)  # Returns "(Int, String) -> Int"

# Evaluate an expression using the function and the semantics from fig_semantics.tex
expr = "f(5, 'hello')"
result = evaluate(expr)  # Returns 10
```

In summary, the files in the `.autodoc/docs/json/docs/spec/figures` folder provide a comprehensive specification of the \langname programming language, including its syntax, semantics, and typing rules. These files can be used as a foundation for implementing interpreters, compilers, and development tools for the language, as well as for reasoning about the behavior of programs written in the language.
