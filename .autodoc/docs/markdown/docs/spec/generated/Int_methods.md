This file contains a set of methods for converting an integer value to different data types. The methods are named according to the target data type, such as `toByte`, `toShort`, `toInt`, `toLong`, `toBigInt`, `toBytes`, and `toBits`. 

Each method takes no parameters and returns the converted value. If the conversion results in an overflow, an exception is thrown. The `toBytes` method returns a collection of bytes in big-endian representation, while the `toBits` method returns a collection of Booleans, each corresponding to one bit in the integer value.

These methods can be used in various parts of the project where integer values need to be converted to different data types. For example, the `toBytes` method can be used to convert an integer value to a byte array for network communication or storage purposes. The `toBigInt` method can be used to convert an integer value to a `BigInt` type for cryptographic operations.

Here is an example of using the `toBytes` method to convert an integer value to a byte array:

```
val intValue = 123456789
val byteArr = intValue.toBytes
```

This will result in `byteArr` containing the bytes `[0x07, 0x5B, 0xCD, 0x15]`, which is the big-endian representation of the integer value `123456789`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of these methods?
- These methods are used to convert an integer value to different data types or representations, such as byte, short, long, big integer, bytes, and bits.

2. What happens if the integer value overflows during conversion?
- The methods throw an exception if the integer value overflows during conversion.

3. What is the format of the output for the toBytes and toBits methods?
- The toBytes method returns a big-endian representation of the integer value in a collection of bytes, while the toBits method returns a big-endian representation of the integer value in a collection of Booleans, where each Boolean corresponds to one bit.
