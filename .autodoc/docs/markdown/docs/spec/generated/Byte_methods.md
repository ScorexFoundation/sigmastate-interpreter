This file contains a set of methods for converting a Byte value to other numeric types or representations. The methods include toByte, toShort, toInt, toLong, toBigInt, toBytes, and toBits. 

Each method takes no parameters and returns the converted value or representation. The toByte, toShort, toInt, and toLong methods throw an exception if the conversion results in an overflow. 

The toBigInt method returns a BigInt representation of the Byte value. The toBytes method returns a collection of bytes in big-endian representation. For example, the Byte value 0x12 would yield the collection of bytes [0x12]. The toBits method returns a collection of Booleans, where each Boolean corresponds to one bit in the Byte value.

These methods can be used in a larger project that requires conversion of Byte values to other numeric types or representations. For example, in a cryptography project, the toBytes method can be used to convert a Byte value to a collection of bytes for encryption or decryption. The toBits method can be used to obtain the individual bits of a Byte value for further processing. 

Code example:

```
val byteValue: Byte = 0x12
val intValue: Int = byteValue.toInt
val byteCollection: Coll[Byte] = byteValue.toBytes
val bitCollection: Coll[Boolean] = byteValue.toBits
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of these methods?
   
   These methods are used to convert a Byte value to other numeric types or representations, such as Short, Int, Long, BigInt, bytes, or bits.

2. What happens if the Byte value overflows during conversion?
   
   If the Byte value overflows during conversion, an exception will be thrown.

3. What is the format of the output for the toBytes and toBits methods?
   
   The toBytes method returns a collection of bytes in big-endian representation, while the toBits method returns a collection of Booleans, with each Boolean corresponding to one bit in the Byte value.
