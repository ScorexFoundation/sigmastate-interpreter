This file contains a set of methods for converting a BigInt value to various other data types. The methods include toByte, toShort, toInt, toLong, and toBigInt. Each method takes no parameters and returns the converted value, throwing an exception if an overflow occurs during the conversion. 

Additionally, there are two methods for converting a BigInt value to a collection of bytes or Booleans. The toBytes method returns a big-endian representation of the numeric value in a collection of bytes, while the toBits method returns a big-endian representation of the numeric value in a collection of Booleans, with each boolean corresponding to one bit.

These methods can be used in a larger project where BigInt values need to be converted to other data types or represented in collections of bytes or Booleans. For example, if a BigInt value needs to be stored in a database as a byte array, the toBytes method can be used to convert the value before storing it. Similarly, if a BigInt value needs to be represented as a sequence of bits, the toBits method can be used. 

Code example:

```
val bigIntValue: BigInt = BigInt("12345678901234567890")
val byteValue: Byte = bigIntValue.toByte
val shortValue: Short = bigIntValue.toShort
val intValue: Int = bigIntValue.toInt
val longValue: Long = bigIntValue.toLong
val byteArray: Array[Byte] = bigIntValue.toBytes.toArray
val bitArray: Array[Boolean] = bigIntValue.toBits.toArray
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of these methods?
- These methods are used to convert a BigInt value to different numeric types or representations.

2. What happens if the conversion results in an overflow?
- The methods will throw an exception if the conversion results in an overflow.

3. What is the difference between the toBytes and toBits methods?
- The toBytes method returns a big-endian representation of the numeric value in a collection of bytes, while the toBits method returns a big-endian representation of the numeric value in a collection of Booleans, with each boolean corresponding to one bit.
