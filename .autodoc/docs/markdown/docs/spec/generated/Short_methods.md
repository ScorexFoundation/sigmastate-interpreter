This file contains a set of methods for converting a Short value to different data types. The methods are named according to the target data type, such as toByte, toShort, toInt, toLong, toBigInt, toBytes, and toBits. 

Each method takes no parameters and returns the converted value. If the conversion results in an overflow, an exception is thrown. 

The toBytes method returns a big-endian representation of the Short value in a collection of bytes. For example, the Short value 0x1234 would yield the collection of bytes [0x12, 0x34]. The toBits method returns a big-endian representation of the Short value in a collection of Booleans, where each Boolean corresponds to one bit. 

These methods can be used in the larger project to convert Short values to other data types as needed. For example, if a function requires an Int value but is given a Short value, the toInt method can be used to convert the Short value to an Int value. Similarly, if a Short value needs to be serialized as a collection of bytes or Booleans, the toBytes and toBits methods can be used, respectively. 

Example usage:

```
val shortValue: Short = 1234
val intValue: Int = shortValue.toInt
val byteCollection: Coll[Byte] = shortValue.toBytes
val booleanCollection: Coll[Boolean] = shortValue.toBits
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of these methods?
- These methods are used to convert a Short value to different data types such as Byte, Short, Int, Long, BigInt, and collections of bytes or Booleans.

2. What happens if there is an overflow during the conversion?
- If there is an overflow during the conversion, an exception is thrown.

3. How is the numeric value represented in the returned collection of bytes or Booleans?
- The numeric value is represented in a big-endian format in the returned collection of bytes or Booleans.
