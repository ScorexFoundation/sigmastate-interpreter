The ErgoScriptPredef object contains two methods that are used in the larger Ergo platform project. The first method, `compileWithCosting`, takes in a `ScriptEnv`, a string of code, and a `NetworkPrefix` and returns a `Value[SType]`. This method compiles the given code using the `SigmaCompiler` and returns the resulting compiled code as a `Value[SType]`. The `IRContext` is an implicit parameter that is used by the `SigmaCompiler` to compile the code.

The second method, `tokenThresholdScript`, takes in a `tokenId`, a `thresholdAmount`, and a `NetworkPrefix` and returns a `SigmaPropValue`. This method generates a script that can be used to determine if a given box can be spent by a transaction that contains at least `thresholdAmount` of the specified `tokenId`. The script is generated by compiling the provided code using the `compileWithCosting` method. The code for the script is a combination of three different versions, each of which uses different methods to calculate the sum of the token amounts. The resulting script checks if the sum of the token amounts is greater than or equal to the `thresholdAmount` and returns a `SigmaPropValue` that can be used to verify the script.

Here is an example of how the `tokenThresholdScript` method can be used:

```
val tokenId: Array[Byte] = Array(1, 2, 3)
val thresholdAmount: Long = 1000
val networkPrefix: NetworkPrefix = NetworkPrefix.MainnetPrefix

val script: SigmaPropValue = ErgoScriptPredef.tokenThresholdScript(tokenId, thresholdAmount, networkPrefix)
```

This code generates a script that can be used to verify if a given box can be spent by a transaction that contains at least 1000 of the token with ID 010203. The resulting script is stored in the `script` variable as a `SigmaPropValue`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoScriptPredef` object?
- The `ErgoScriptPredef` object contains a method for compiling a script with costing and a method for generating a proposition for a box that can be spent by a transaction with a certain token threshold.

2. What is the significance of the `tokenId` and `thresholdAmount` parameters in the `tokenThresholdScript` method?
- The `tokenId` parameter specifies the ID of the token that is being checked for in the box inputs, while the `thresholdAmount` parameter specifies the minimum amount of that token required for the box to be spendable.

3. What is the purpose of the `sigmaProp` function in the `tokenThresholdScript` method?
- The `sigmaProp` function is used to generate a `SigmaPropValue` that represents the proposition for the spendable box, based on the total amount of the specified token in the input boxes meeting the threshold requirement.
