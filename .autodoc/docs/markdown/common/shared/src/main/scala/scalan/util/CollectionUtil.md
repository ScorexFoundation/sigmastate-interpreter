The CollectionUtil object provides utility functions for working with collections in Scala. 

The `concatArrays` method is deprecated and should not be used. It concatenates two arrays of the same type into a new array. The `concatArrays_v5` method is the recommended replacement for `concatArrays`. It concatenates two arrays of the same type into a new array using `System.arraycopy`. It takes a `ClassTag` to create the proper resulting array.

The `deepHashCode` method returns a hash code for an array. It uses `java.util.Arrays` to compute the hash code.

The `createMultiMap` method groups a sequence of pairs by their first values as keys. It returns a multimap with an `ArrayBuffer` of values for each key.

The `joinSeqs` method performs a relational inner join of two sequences using the given key projections. It takes two sequences, `outer` and `inner`, and two functions, `outKey` and `inKey`, that extract the keys from the elements of the sequences. It returns a sequence of pairs of elements from `outer` and `inner` that have the same key.

The `outerJoinSeqs` method performs an outer join of two sequences using the given key projections. It takes two sequences, `outer` and `inner`, and three functions, `outKey`, `inKey`, and `proj`, that extract the keys from the elements of the sequences and combine the elements into a result. It returns a sequence of pairs of keys and results.

The `AnyOps` implicit class provides a `traverseDepthFirst` method that traverses a tree of elements depth-first and returns a list of elements.

The `TraversableOps` implicit class provides several methods for working with collections. The `updateMany` method returns a copy of the collection where elements at the specified indices are replaced with the specified values. The `cast` method checks that each element of the collection is of a specified type and returns the collection casted to that type. The `distinctBy` method returns a new collection with duplicate elements removed based on a key function. The `sameElements2` method checks if two collections have the same elements in the same order, including nested collections and arrays.

Overall, the CollectionUtil object provides a set of useful utility functions for working with collections in Scala. These functions can be used in a variety of contexts to manipulate and transform collections.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `concatArrays` method and why is it deprecated?
- The `concatArrays` method concatenates two arrays into a new resulting array, but it is deprecated and should only be used for backwards compatibility with v3.x and v4.x.
2. What is the difference between the `createMultiMap` and `joinSeqs` methods?
- The `createMultiMap` method groups a given sequence of pairs by first values as keys and returns a multimap with ArrayBuffer of values for each key, while the `joinSeqs` method performs a relational inner join of two sequences using the given key projections.
3. What is the purpose of the `distinctBy` method and why is it needed?
- The `distinctBy` method is used to return a new collection with distinct elements based on a key function, and it is needed for compatibility with Scala 2.11.
