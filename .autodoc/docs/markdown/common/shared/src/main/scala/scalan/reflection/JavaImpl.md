The `JRClass` class is a wrapper around a Java `Class` object that provides reflective access to the class's fields, methods, and constructors. It implements the `RClass` trait, which defines methods for accessing these reflective elements. 

The `fields` and `methods` properties are mutable hash maps that cache `RField` and `RMethod` objects, respectively, for each field and method of the wrapped class. The `getField` and `getMethod` methods use these caches to return the corresponding `RField` or `RMethod` object for a given field or method name and parameter types. These methods use the `memoize` function from the `RClass` companion object to lazily compute and cache the `RField` or `RMethod` object if it has not already been cached.

The `constructors` property is a mutable array that caches `RConstructor` objects for each constructor of the wrapped class. The `getConstructors` method uses double-checked locking to lazily compute and cache the `RConstructor` objects if they have not already been cached. It uses the `cfor` function from the `debox` library to iterate over the array of `Constructor[Any]` objects returned by `value.getConstructors`, and creates a new `JRConstructor` object for each one. The `getUsedConstructors` method returns a filtered sequence of `JRConstructor` objects that have been used to create new instances of the wrapped class.

The remaining methods of `JRClass` provide access to various properties of the wrapped class, such as its simple name, full name, superclass, and whether it is a primitive type. The `getDeclaredMethods` method returns an array of `RMethod` objects for all methods declared by the wrapped class.

The `JRField`, `JRConstructor`, and `JRMethod` classes are private helper classes that implement the `RField`, `RConstructor`, and `RMethod` traits, respectively. They provide a thin wrapper around the corresponding Java reflection classes, and are used by `JRClass` to create the `RField`, `RConstructor`, and `RMethod` objects that it caches.

The `RInvocationException` class is a custom exception that is thrown when an invocation of a reflective method fails.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `JRClass` class?
- The `JRClass` class is a wrapper around the `java.lang.Class` class that provides additional functionality for reflection.

2. What is the purpose of the `memoize` method?
- The `memoize` method is used to cache the results of method calls to improve performance by avoiding redundant computations.

3. What is the purpose of the `RInvocationException` class?
- The `RInvocationException` class is a custom exception that is thrown when an error occurs during a reflection invocation.
