# StringUtil Code Explanation

The `StringUtil` object contains utility functions for manipulating strings. The purpose of this code is to provide a set of functions that can be used to manipulate strings in various ways. 

The `quote` function takes an input `x` of any type and returns a string with the input enclosed in double quotes. This function can be used to format strings for display or output.

The `deepAppend` function takes a `StringBuilder` object and an input `x` of any type. It recursively descends into the array structure of `x` and appends a string representation of `x` to the `StringBuilder`. This function can be used to convert complex data structures to strings for display or output.

The `cleanFileName` function takes an input string and returns a new string that can be used as a file name. This function replaces spaces with hyphens and removes any characters that are not printable. This function can be used to sanitize user input for use as a file name.

The `fileName` function takes a file name and a list of path components and returns a string that represents the full file path. This function can be used to construct file paths from components.

The `StringUtilExtensions` class provides two extension methods for strings. The `isNullOrEmpty` method returns true if the string is null or empty. The `opt` method takes two optional parameters: a function to apply to the string and a default value to return if the string is empty. This method can be used to provide a default value for empty strings.

Overall, the `StringUtil` object provides a set of utility functions for manipulating strings that can be used in a variety of contexts.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `deepAppend` method do?
   - The `deepAppend` method takes a `StringBuilder` and an object `x` as input and recursively descends into the Array structure of `x` to emit its string representation into the `StringBuilder`.
2. What is the purpose of the `cleanFileName` method?
   - The `cleanFileName` method accepts a string and returns a similar string that can be used as a file name. It replaces spaces and certain special characters with underscores to ensure that the resulting string is a valid file name.
3. What is the purpose of the `StringUtilExtensions` class?
   - The `StringUtilExtensions` class provides two extension methods for the `String` class: `isNullOrEmpty` checks if the string is null or empty, and `opt` returns the string if it is not empty, otherwise it returns a default value.
