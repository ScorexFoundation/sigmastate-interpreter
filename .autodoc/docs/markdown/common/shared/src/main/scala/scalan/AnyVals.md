The code provided in this file offers two classes, Nullable and AVHashMap, which provide allocation-free alternatives to Scala's Option and mutable Map classes, respectively. 

The Nullable class is designed to avoid the allocation of Some(x) and the reading of random memory locations to access x. It is a wrapper around a value of type T that can be null. The class provides methods such as isEmpty, get, isDefined, getOrElse, toList, and toOption. The getOrElse method returns the value of the Nullable object if it is not null, otherwise it returns a default value. The toList method returns a List containing the value of the Nullable object if it is not null, otherwise it returns an empty List. The toOption method returns an Option containing the value of the Nullable object if it is not null, otherwise it returns None.

The AVHashMap class is designed to provide an allocation-free alternative to Scala's mutable Map class. It is a wrapper around a Java HashMap that provides methods such as isEmpty, get, apply, containsKey, put, and clear. The get method returns a Nullable object containing the value associated with the given key if it exists in the map, otherwise it returns a Nullable object containing null. The apply method returns the value associated with the given key if it exists in the map, otherwise it throws an exception. The containsKey method returns true if the given key exists in the map, otherwise it returns false. The put method associates the given value with the given key in the map and returns the previous value associated with the key, if any. The clear method removes all entries from the map. 

The AVHashMap class also provides two helper methods, apply and fromSeq. The apply method creates a new AVHashMap with the given initial capacity. The fromSeq method creates a new AVHashMap from a sequence of key-value pairs. 

These classes can be used in the larger project to optimize performance-critical code by avoiding unnecessary allocations and memory accesses. For example, the Nullable class can be used in recognizers to avoid the allocation of Some(x) and the reading of random memory locations to access x. The AVHashMap class can be used to provide an allocation-free alternative to Scala's mutable Map class.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Nullable class?
   
   The Nullable class is an allocation-free alternative to scala.Option that allows avoiding the allocation of Some(x) and reading random memory location (where Some is stored) to access x.

2. What is the purpose of the AVHashMap class?
   
   The AVHashMap class is an allocation-free alternative to scala.collection.mutable.Map that simplifies optimization of performance-critical code.

3. How can a new map be created using the AVHashMap class?
   
   A new map can be created using the AVHashMap class by calling the apply method with the initial capacity as a parameter or by calling the fromSeq method with a sequence of K, V pairs as a parameter.
