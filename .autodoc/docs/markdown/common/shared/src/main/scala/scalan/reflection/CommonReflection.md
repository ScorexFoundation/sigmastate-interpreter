The CommonReflection object in the scalan.reflection package contains a set of utility methods for registering and storing information about classes and their constructors, fields, and methods. The main purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for storing metadata about classes that can be used by other parts of the project.

The classes variable is a mutable HashMap that stores instances of the SRClass class, which contains information about a given class's constructors, fields, and methods. The registerClassEntry method is used to add new entries to the classes HashMap. It takes a Class object as its first argument, which is the class to be registered, and optional arguments for the class's constructors, fields, and methods. The method is synchronized to ensure thread safety when adding new entries to the HashMap.

The code then proceeds to register several built-in classes, such as Boolean, Byte, Short, Int, Long, and Product2. It also registers the immutable List class and its cons (::) constructor, which takes an Object and a List as arguments. Additionally, it registers the Option and Some classes, along with their filter and map methods.

Overall, this code provides a way to store and retrieve metadata about classes in a centralized location, which can be useful for other parts of the project that need to access this information. For example, other parts of the project may use this metadata to generate code or perform runtime reflection. Here is an example of how this code could be used to retrieve information about a registered class:

```
val clazz = classOf[Boolean]
val srClass = CommonReflection.classes.get(clazz)
if (srClass.isDefined) {
  // do something with srClass
} else {
  // handle case where clazz is not registered
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CommonReflection` object?
- The `CommonReflection` object contains a `registerClassEntry` method that registers information about classes, constructors, fields, and methods. It is used to reflect on the structure of classes at runtime.

2. What is the purpose of the `classes` mutable HashMap?
- The `classes` HashMap is used to store information about registered classes, with the class object as the key and an `SRClass` object as the value. This allows for efficient lookup of class information at runtime.

3. What is the purpose of the code block that registers information about `scala.Option` and `scala.Some`?
- The code block registers information about the `filter` and `map` methods for `scala.Option`, and the constructor for `scala.Some`. This allows for reflection on these classes and their methods at runtime.
