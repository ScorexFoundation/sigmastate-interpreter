The code in this file provides a set of implicit classes and methods that extend the functionality of built-in Scala types. These extensions include methods for converting between numeric types, performing arithmetic operations with overflow checking, and converting boolean values to bytes. 

One notable method is `to256BitValueExact`, which checks whether a given `BigInteger` can be represented as a 256-bit two's-complement value. This method is used in deserialization to ensure that a `BigInteger` value can be safely converted to a fixed-size byte array without losing information. 

The code also includes an implicit class called `Ensuring`, which provides a way to add runtime assertions to any value. The `ensuring` method takes a condition and an error message, and throws an exception if the condition is not met. This can be useful for enforcing invariants or validating input parameters. 

Overall, this code provides a set of utility functions that can be used throughout a larger project to extend the functionality of built-in types and perform common operations with additional safety checks. 

Example usage:

```scala
import scalan.util.Extensions._

val x: Int = 100
val y: Short = 200
val z: Byte = 1

// Convert between numeric types
val xByte: Byte = x.toByteExact
val yInt: Int = y.toIntExact
val zShort: Short = z.toShortExact

// Perform arithmetic operations with overflow checking
val sum: Byte = z.addExact(xByte)
val diff: Short = y.subtractExact(xByte)
val prod: Byte = z.multiplyExact(xByte)

// Convert boolean values to bytes
val trueByte: Byte = true.toByte
val falseByte: Byte = false.toByte

// Add runtime assertions to a value
val result = x + y + z
result.ensuring(_ > 0, _ => s"Result should be positive but was $result")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Extensions` object and its implicit classes?
- The `Extensions` object contains implicit classes that provide additional functionality to primitive types such as `Byte`, `Short`, `Int`, `Long`, `Boolean`, and `BigInteger`.
2. What is the purpose of the `toUByte` method?
- The `toUByte` method is used to convert a signed byte to an unsigned byte by masking the byte with `0xFF`.
3. What is the purpose of the `to256BitValueExact` method?
- The `to256BitValueExact` method checks if a `BigInteger` can be represented as a 256-bit two's-complement value and returns the value if it can, otherwise it throws an `ArithmeticException`.
