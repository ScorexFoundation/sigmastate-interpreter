The `Collections.scala` file in the `.autodoc/docs/json/common/shared/src/main/scala-2.11/sigmastate/kiama/util` folder provides utility functions for working with collections in Scala, particularly when interfacing with Java libraries. It defines a Scala object called `Collections` that contains several methods for converting between Java and Scala collections, as well as for building collections.

### Converting Java collections to Scala collections

The first set of methods are for converting Java collections to Scala collections. These methods use the `JavaConverters` library to convert a Java collection to a Scala collection. For example, the `javaCollectionToVector` method takes a `java.util.Collection` and returns a `Vector`, which is a type of immutable sequence in Scala:

```scala
import java.util.ArrayList
import sigmastate.kiama.util.Collections._

val javaList = new ArrayList[String]()
javaList.add("hello")
javaList.add("world")

val scalaVector = javaCollectionToVector(javaList)
```

### Converting Scala collections to Java collections

The second and third methods, `mapToJavaMap` and `seqToJavaList`, take a Scala `Map` and `Seq` respectively and return their Java counterparts, `java.util.Map` and `java.util.List`. These methods can be useful when working with Java libraries that require Java collections as input:

```scala
import scala.collection.immutable.HashMap
import java.util.List
import sigmastate.kiama.util.Collections._

val scalaMap = HashMap("one" -> 1, "two" -> 2)
val javaMap = mapToJavaMap(scalaMap)

val scalaSeq = Seq("hello", "world")
val javaList: List[String] = seqToJavaList(scalaSeq)
```

### Building collections

The `newBuilder` method takes a `Factory` or `CanBuildFrom` object and returns a `Builder` object. The `Factory` and `CanBuildFrom` types are part of the Scala collections library and are used to create new collections. The `newBuilder` method can be used to create a new `Builder` object that can be used to add elements to a collection:

```scala
import scala.collection.mutable.Builder
import scala.collection.immutable.Vector
import sigmastate.kiama.util.Collections._

val builder: Builder[String, Vector[String]] = newBuilder(Vector)
builder += "hello"
builder += "world"

val scalaVector = builder.result()
```

In summary, the `Collections.scala` file provides useful utility functions for working with collections in Scala, particularly when interfacing with Java libraries. These functions can be used to convert between Java and Scala collections and to build new collections using the `Builder` object.
