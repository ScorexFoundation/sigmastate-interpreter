The `EncryptionSettings.scala` file is part of the `org.ergoplatform.sdk.wallet.settings` package and provides a case class and JSON encoding/decoding functionality for encryption settings used in the PBKDF2 algorithm. The main purpose of this code is to define the encryption parameters, store them in a JSON format, and retrieve them when needed.

The `EncryptionSettings` case class has three parameters:

- `prf`: A string representing the pseudo-random function used by the PBKDF2 algorithm.
- `c`: An integer representing the number of iterations used by the PBKDF2 algorithm.
- `dkLen`: An integer representing the desired bit-length of the derived key.

The `EncryptionSettingsEncoder` object implements the `Encoder` trait for the `EncryptionSettings` case class. It defines an `apply` method that takes an instance of `EncryptionSettings` and returns a JSON object representing the instance. The JSON object has three fields: `prf`, `c`, and `dkLen`, with values obtained from the corresponding parameters of the `EncryptionSettings` instance.

The `EncryptionSettingsDecoder` object implements the `Decoder` trait for the `EncryptionSettings` case class. It defines an `apply` method that takes a `HCursor` instance and returns a `Decoder.Result` instance representing the `EncryptionSettings` instance. The `HCursor` instance is used to navigate the JSON object representing the `EncryptionSettings` instance, and the `as` method extracts the values of the `prf`, `c`, and `dkLen` fields from the JSON object. These values are then used to create a new instance of the `EncryptionSettings` case class.

This code can be used in the larger project to define encryption parameters for the PBKDF2 algorithm, store them in a JSON format, and retrieve them when needed. This allows the encryption parameters to be stored and retrieved from a file or database.

Example usage:

```scala
val encryptionSettings = EncryptionSettings("HmacSHA256", 10000, 256)
val json = encryptionSettings.asJson
val jsonString = json.noSpaces
// Store jsonString in a file or database

// Retrieve jsonString from a file or database
val json = parser.parse(jsonString).getOrElse(Json.Null)
val encryptionSettings = json.as[EncryptionSettings].getOrElse(throw new Exception("Invalid JSON"))
```

In summary, the `EncryptionSettings.scala` file provides a case class and JSON encoding/decoding functionality for encryption settings used in the PBKDF2 algorithm. This allows the larger project to store and retrieve encryption parameters in a JSON format, making it easier to manage and maintain the encryption settings.
