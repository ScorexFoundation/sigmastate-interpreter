This code defines a set of traits and classes for handling secret keys in the Ergo Platform SDK wallet. The purpose of this code is to provide a basic framework for handling secret data, encapsulating a corresponding private input for a Sigma protocol. 

The `SecretKey` trait defines a basic interface for secret data, with a single method `privateInput` that returns the private input of a Sigma protocol. This trait is extended by the `PrimitiveSecretKey` trait, which represents a secret that does not have a derivation scheme. 

The `PrimitiveSecretKey` object provides a factory method for creating instances of `PrimitiveSecretKey` from a `SigmaProtocolPrivateInput`. This method uses pattern matching to determine the type of the input and returns either a `DlogSecretKey` or a `DhtSecretKey` instance, depending on the input type. 

The `DlogSecretKey` and `DhtSecretKey` classes represent secret exponents of a group element, i.e. secret `w` such as `h = g^^w`, where `g` is a group generator and `h` is a public key. `DlogSecretKey` represents the secret exponent of a group element in a discrete logarithm group, while `DhtSecretKey` represents the secret exponent of a Diffie-Hellman tuple. Both classes take a private input in the form of a Sigma-protocol private input as a constructor argument. 

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for handling secret keys in the Ergo Platform SDK wallet. It allows for the creation of instances of `PrimitiveSecretKey`, which can be used to represent secret exponents of group elements in discrete logarithm groups or Diffie-Hellman tuples. These secret keys can then be used in other parts of the wallet to perform various cryptographic operations. 

Example usage:

```
val dlogInput = DLogProverInput(...)
val dlogSecretKey = DlogSecretKey(dlogInput)

val dhtInput = DiffieHellmanTupleProverInput(...)
val dhtSecretKey = DhtSecretKey(dhtInput)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines traits and case classes for secret keys used in Sigma protocols.

2. What Sigma protocols are supported by this code?
- The code supports Sigma protocols that use DLogProverInput and DiffieHellmanTupleProverInput.

3. What is the difference between DlogSecretKey and DhtSecretKey?
- DlogSecretKey represents the secret exponent of a group element, while DhtSecretKey represents the secret exponent of a Diffie-Hellman tuple.
