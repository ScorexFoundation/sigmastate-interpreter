# ReducingInterpreter Class

The `ReducingInterpreter` class is a part of the Ergo Platform SDK and is used to reduce transactions with given chain parameters. The class extends the `ErgoLikeInterpreter` class and overrides its `CTX` type with `ErgoLikeContext`. It also imports various classes and objects from the SDK and other libraries.

## reduce Method

The `reduce` method takes in three parameters: `env`, `ergoTree`, and `context`. It reduces the given `ErgoTree` in the given context to the sigma proposition. The method returns a data object containing enough data to sign a transaction without context. 

The `initCost` is calculated by adding the complexity of the `ErgoTree` and the `initCost` of the context. If the `remainingLimit` is less than or equal to 0, a `CostLimitException` is thrown. The `ctxUpdInitCost` is the context with the updated `initCost`. The `fullReduction` method is called with the `ergoTree`, `ctxUpdInitCost`, and `env` as parameters. The result of the `fullReduction` method and the `extension` of the `ctxUpdInitCost` are used to create a `ReducedInputData` object which is returned.

## reduceTransaction Method

The `reduceTransaction` method takes in three parameters: `unreducedTx`, `stateContext`, and `baseCost`. It reduces inputs of the given unsigned transaction to provable sigma propositions using the given context. The method returns a new reduced transaction with all inputs reduced and the cost of this transaction. 

The `unsignedTx`, `boxesToSpend`, `dataBoxes`, and `tokensToBurn` are extracted from the `unreducedTx`. The `inputTokens` and `outputTokens` are extracted from the `boxesToSpend` and `unsignedTx.outputCandidates`, respectively. The `tokenDiff` is calculated by subtracting `inputTokens` from `outputTokens`. If `tokenDiff` is not empty, the method checks if tokens are to be burnt or minted. If tokens are to be burnt, the method checks if the requested tokens to burn match the tokens to be burnt. If tokens are to be minted, the method checks if only one token is being minted and if the token id is valid. 

The `initialCost` is calculated by adding the interpreter initialization cost, the input cost multiplied by the number of inputs, the data input cost multiplied by the number of data inputs, and the output cost multiplied by the number of output candidates. The `maxCost` is the maximum cost of the block. The `startCost` is the sum of the `baseCost` and the `initialCost`. The `transactionContext` is created with the boxes to spend, data inputs, and unsigned transaction. The `outAssets` and `outAssetsNum` are extracted from the `unsignedTx.outputCandidates`. The `inAssets` and `inAssetsNum` are extracted from the `boxesToSpend`. The `totalAssetsAccessCost` is calculated by adding the token access cost multiplied by the sum of `outAssetsNum` and `inAssetsNum` and the token access cost multiplied by the sum of the sizes of `inAssets` and `outAssets`. The `txCost` is the sum of the `startCost` and the `totalAssetsAccessCost`. 

The method then iterates through the `boxesToSpend` and creates a new `ErgoLikeContext` for each input. The `reduce` method is called with the `Interpreter.emptyEnv`, the `ergoTree` of the input box, and the context as parameters. The result of the `reduce` method and the `currentCost` are used to create a `ReducedInputData` object which is added to the `reducedInputs` array builder. The `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` is created with the `unsignedTx` and the `reducedInputs`. The `ReducedTransaction` is created with the `reducedTx` and the `currentCost`. 

Overall, the `ReducingInterpreter` class provides methods to reduce an `ErgoTree` to a sigma proposition and to reduce inputs of an unsigned transaction to provable sigma propositions using a given context.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReducingInterpreter` class?
- The `ReducingInterpreter` class is an interpreter that can reduce transactions with given chain parameters.

2. What methods does the `ReducingInterpreter` class have?
- The `ReducingInterpreter` class has two methods: `reduce` and `reduceTransaction`.

3. What exceptions can be thrown by the `reduce` method?
- The `reduce` method can throw a `CostLimitException` if the estimated execution cost exceeds the limit.
