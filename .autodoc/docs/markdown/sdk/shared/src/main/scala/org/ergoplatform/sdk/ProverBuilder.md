The `ProverBuilder` class is a part of the Ergo Platform SDK and is used to build a `Prover` object that can be used to create proofs for transactions on the Ergo blockchain. The `ProverBuilder` class provides methods to add various types of secrets to the prover, such as mnemonic phrases, Diffie-Hellman tuples, and discrete logarithms.

The `ProverBuilder` constructor takes two arguments: `parameters` of type `ErgoLikeParameters` and `networkPrefix` of type `NetworkPrefix`. The `ErgoLikeParameters` object contains various parameters that define the context in which the prover will operate, such as the block height, the minimum box value, and the cost of executing scripts. The `NetworkPrefix` object specifies the network prefix of the Ergo blockchain, which is used to encode and decode Ergo addresses.

The `ProverBuilder` class has several methods that can be used to add secrets to the prover. The `withMnemonic` method takes a `mnemonicPhrase` and a `mnemonicPass` of type `SecretString` and a `usePre1627KeyDerivation` of type `Boolean`. The `mnemonicPhrase` is a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase that can be used to generate a master key for the prover. The `mnemonicPass` is an optional passphrase that can be used to further secure the mnemonic phrase. The `usePre1627KeyDerivation` flag specifies whether to use the pre-1627 key derivation scheme or the post-1627 key derivation scheme. The method returns the `ProverBuilder` object to allow for method chaining.

The `withEip3Secret` method takes an `index` of type `Int` and generates a secret key using the EIP-3 key derivation scheme. The method requires that a master key has already been added using the `withMnemonic` method. The generated secret key is paired with its derivation path index and added to the `_eip2Keys` array buffer. The method returns the `ProverBuilder` object to allow for method chaining.

The `withDHTData` method takes a `g`, `h`, `u`, `v`, and `x` of types `GroupElement` and `BigInteger`. These parameters are used to create a Diffie-Hellman tuple prover input using the `JavaHelpers.createDiffieHellmanTupleProverInput` method. The resulting prover input is added to the `_dhtSecrets` array buffer. The method throws an exception if the same prover input has already been added. The method returns the `ProverBuilder` object to allow for method chaining.

The `withDLogSecret` method takes an `x` of type `BigInteger` and creates a discrete logarithm prover input using the `DLogProtocol.DLogProverInput` constructor. The resulting prover input is added to the `_dLogSecrets` array buffer. The method throws an exception if the same prover input has already been added. The method returns the `ProverBuilder` object to allow for method chaining.

The `build` method creates a `Prover` object using the secrets that have been added to the `ProverBuilder`. The method first combines the master key and the EIP-3 secret keys into a single sequence of secret keys. It then creates an `AppkitProvingInterpreter` object using the secret keys, DLog secrets, DHT secrets, and ErgoLikeParameters. Finally, it creates a `Prover` object using the `AppkitProvingInterpreter` and the `networkPrefix`. The `Prover` object can be used to create proofs for transactions on the Ergo blockchain.

Example usage:

```
val parameters = new ErgoLikeParameters(...)
val networkPrefix = NetworkPrefix.MainnetPrefix
val proverBuilder = new ProverBuilder(parameters, networkPrefix)
proverBuilder.withMnemonic(mnemonicPhrase, mnemonicPass, usePre1627KeyDerivation)
proverBuilder.withEip3Secret(index)
proverBuilder.withDHTData(g, h, u, v, x)
proverBuilder.withDLogSecret(x)
val prover = proverBuilder.build()
```
