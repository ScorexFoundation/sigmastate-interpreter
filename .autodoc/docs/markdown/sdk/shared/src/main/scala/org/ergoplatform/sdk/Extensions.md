The `Extensions` object contains several implicit classes that provide additional functionality to existing Scala and Ergo data structures. These classes are designed to simplify common operations and improve code readability.

The `GenIterableOps` class provides a `mapReduce` method that applies a map function to each element of a collection, groups the results by key, and reduces each group using a reduce function. The resulting collection is a new collection of (K,V) pairs, where K is the key and V is the reduced value. This method is useful for performing complex operations on collections, such as aggregating data or calculating statistics.

The `CollOps` class provides several methods for working with Ergo's `Coll` data structure. These methods include `partition`, which partitions a collection into two collections based on a predicate; `toMap`, which converts a collection of (K,V) pairs to an immutable map; `sum`, which sums the elements of a collection using a `Numeric` type; `mapReduce`, which applies a map function to each element of a collection, groups the results by key, and reduces each group using a reduce function; and `groupBy` and `groupByProjecting`, which partition a collection into a map of collections based on a discriminator function.

The `PairCollOps` class provides additional methods for working with Ergo's `PairColl` data structure. These methods include `mapFirst` and `mapSecond`, which map the first and second components of each pair in the collection, respectively; `reduceByKey`, which uses the first component of each pair in the collection as a key for grouping and reducing the corresponding values; `sumByKey`, which uses the first component of each pair in the collection as a key for grouping and summing the corresponding values using a `Numeric` type; and `groupByKey`, which uses the first component of each pair in the collection as a key for grouping the corresponding values into a new collection.

The `CollBuilderOps` class provides additional methods for working with Ergo's `CollBuilder` data structure. These methods include `outerJoin`, which performs an outer join operation between two collections and returns a collection of (K,O) pairs, where each key comes from either the left or right collection and values are produced by projections; and `fromMap`, which constructs a collection of (K,V) pairs using a `PairColl` representation, in which keys and values are stored as separate unboxed arrays.

Overall, these implicit classes provide a wide range of functionality for working with collections in Ergo and can greatly simplify complex operations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Extensions` object?
- The `Extensions` object contains several implicit classes that provide additional functionality to existing classes, such as `GenIterable`, `Coll`, and `CollBuilder`.

2. What is the purpose of the `mapReduce` method in the `GenIterableOps` class?
- The `mapReduce` method applies a mapping function to each element of a collection, groups the elements by key, and reduces each group using a reduction function. The result is a new collection of (key, value) pairs, with one item for each group.

3. What is the purpose of the `outerJoin` method in the `CollBuilderOps` class?
- The `outerJoin` method performs an outer join operation between two collections, using projection functions to produce values for each element of the left and right collections, and an inner projection function to produce values for matching items with the same key. The result is a new collection of (key, value) pairs, with keys coming from either the left or right collection and values produced by the projection functions.
