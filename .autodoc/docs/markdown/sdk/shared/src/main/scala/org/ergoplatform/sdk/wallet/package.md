The code above defines a package object called "wallet" within the "org.ergoplatform.sdk" package. This package object contains a type alias called "TokensMap", which is a Map data structure that maps ModifierId objects to Long values. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to represent a mapping of tokens to their corresponding amounts. This can be useful in the context of a cryptocurrency wallet, where a user may hold multiple types of tokens and need to keep track of their balances. 

For example, if a user has 10 Ergo tokens and 5 Bitcoin tokens in their wallet, the TokensMap could be represented as follows:

```
val tokens: TokensMap = Map(
  ModifierId("ErgoToken") -> 10L,
  ModifierId("BitcoinToken") -> 5L
)
```

This code can be used in conjunction with other parts of the project to implement wallet functionality, such as displaying token balances to the user or performing transactions between different token types. 

Overall, the TokensMap type alias provides a simple and flexible way to represent token balances within the Ergo Platform SDK.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `org.ergoplatform.sdk` package?
   - This package likely contains code related to the Ergo blockchain platform, but without more context it's difficult to determine its specific purpose.

2. What is the significance of the `scorex.util.ModifierId` import?
   - This import likely provides access to a data type used to identify and modify blockchain transactions or blocks.

3. What is the purpose of the `TokensMap` type alias defined in the `wallet` package object?
   - This type alias defines a mapping between `ModifierId` objects and `Long` values, likely used to represent token balances in a cryptocurrency wallet.
