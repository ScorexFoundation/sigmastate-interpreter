This code defines a set of parsers for ErgoScript expressions, which are part of the Ergo blockchain platform. ErgoScript is a language used to write smart contracts on the Ergo platform. The parsers are implemented using the FastParse library and are organized in a trait called `Exprs`, which extends the `Core` and `Types` traits.

The `Exprs` trait contains several parsers for different types of expressions, such as `BlockDef`, `If`, `Fun`, and `LambdaRhs`. These parsers are used to parse various ErgoScript constructs like variable definitions, if-else expressions, function definitions, and lambda expressions. The trait also provides utility methods like `mkInfixTree`, `applySuffix`, and `block` to build the abstract syntax tree (AST) for the parsed expressions.

The code also defines a `WsCtx` class, which represents the parsing context for expressions. It has three derived classes: `StatCtx`, `ExprCtx`, and `FreeCtx`. These classes are used to handle different parsing scenarios, such as expressions used as statements, expressions nested within other expressions, and expressions directly within a `val x = ...` or `def x = ...`.

An example of using these parsers in a larger project would be to parse ErgoScript code and generate an AST, which can then be used for further processing, such as type checking, optimization, or code generation.

Here's an example of how the `Expr` parser can be used:

```scala
val input = "if (x > 0) x * 2 else x / 2"
val parsedExpr = fastparse.parse(input, Exprs.Expr(_))
```

This code snippet would parse the input string containing an ErgoScript expression and return a parsed expression in the form of an AST.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `WsCtx` class and its parameters `semiInference` and `arrowTypeAscriptions`?
   **Answer**: The `WsCtx` class represents the parsing context of expressions. The `semiInference` parameter determines whether semicolon inference is enabled, and the `arrowTypeAscriptions` parameter determines whether arrow-type ascriptions like `i: a => b` are allowed in the current context.

2. **Question**: How does the `mkInfixTree` function handle operator precedence when constructing the expression tree?
   **Answer**: The `mkInfixTree` function uses a tail-recursive algorithm to build the expression tree while respecting operator precedence. It maintains a stack of waiting operations and iteratively processes the input list of operations, comparing the precedence of the current operation with the next one to decide whether to apply the current operation or push it onto the stack.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `priorityList` and `priorityMap` variables in the code?
   **Answer**: The `priorityList` variable defines the precedence levels of infix operators based on their first character, with characters on the same line having the same precedence. The `priorityMap` variable is a derived map that associates each operator character with its precedence level, making it easier to look up the precedence of a given operator during expression tree construction.
