The `Identifiers` object in the `sigmastate.lang.syntax` package provides functionality for parsing and identifying identifiers and keywords in the Sigma programming language. 

The `Identifiers` object defines several parsers for different types of identifiers. The `VarId` parser matches variable names, which must start with a lowercase letter and can contain letters, digits, and underscores. The `UppercaseId` parser matches type names, which must start with an uppercase letter and can contain letters, digits, and underscores. The `PlainId` parser matches any identifier that is not enclosed in backticks, including variable names, type names, and operators. The `PlainIdNoDollar` parser matches the same identifiers as `PlainId`, but does not allow dollar signs in variable names. The `BacktickId` parser matches any identifier enclosed in backticks, allowing it to contain any characters except backticks.

The `Identifiers` object also defines parsers for operators and keywords. The `Operator` parser matches any operator symbol that is not a keyword, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators. The `Keywords` parser matches any keyword in the Sigma language, including `case`, `else`, `false`, `function`, `if`, `match`, `return`, `then`, and `true`. 

Overall, the `Identifiers` object is an important part of the Sigma language parser, allowing it to identify and parse different types of identifiers and keywords. It can be used in conjunction with other parsers in the `sigmastate.lang.syntax` package to parse Sigma code and generate an abstract syntax tree. 

Example usage:
```
import fastparse._
import sigmastate.lang.syntax.Identifiers._

val result = parse("x + y", PlainId(_))
// result: Parsed.Success[Unit] = Success((), 5)

val result2 = parse("if (x > y) then x else y", Keywords(_))
// result2: Parsed.Failure = Failure("if (x > y) then x else y", 0)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Identifiers` object?
- The `Identifiers` object defines parsers for identifiers and keywords in the syntax of a programming language.

2. What is the difference between `VarId` and `PlainId`?
- `VarId` matches an identifier that starts with a lowercase letter, while `PlainId` matches an identifier that starts with an uppercase letter or an operator.

3. What is the purpose of the `NamedFunction` case class?
- The `NamedFunction` case class is a helper wrapper that captures the name of the use site and provides a custom `toString` method for debugging purposes. It is used to define a function that takes a character and returns a boolean value.
