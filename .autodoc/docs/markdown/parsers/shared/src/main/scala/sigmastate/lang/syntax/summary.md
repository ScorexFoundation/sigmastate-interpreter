The `.autodoc/docs/json/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/syntax` folder contains Scala code for parsing ErgoScript, a scripting language used in the Ergo blockchain platform. The code is organized into several files, each providing specific functionality for parsing different aspects of the language.

`Basic.scala` provides parsers for basic lexical elements, such as numbers, operators, and keywords. These parsers are essential building blocks for parsing ErgoScript code and generating an abstract syntax tree (AST).

`Core.scala` defines a trait called "Core" that contains common aliases and keywords used in almost every parser in the file. It also provides methods for constructing ErgoTree unary and binary operations.

`Exprs.scala` defines a set of parsers for ErgoScript expressions, organized in a trait called `Exprs`. These parsers are used to parse various ErgoScript constructs and build the AST for the parsed expressions.

`Identifiers.scala` provides functionality for parsing and identifying identifiers and keywords in the Sigma programming language. It defines several parsers for different types of identifiers, operators, and keywords.

`Literals.scala` is a collection of parsers for literal expressions used in the Sigma programming language. It defines methods for parsing different types of literals, including integers, booleans, strings, and null values, as well as whitespace and comments.

Here's an example of how the `Expr` parser from `Exprs.scala` can be used:

```scala
val input = "if (x > 0) x * 2 else x / 2"
val parsedExpr = fastparse.parse(input, Exprs.Expr(_))
```

This code snippet would parse the input string containing an ErgoScript expression and return a parsed expression in the form of an AST.

Overall, the code in this folder is crucial for parsing ErgoScript code and generating an AST, which can then be used for further processing, such as type checking, optimization, or code generation. The parsers are implemented using the FastParse library and are designed to work together to handle the various constructs and expressions found in ErgoScript.
