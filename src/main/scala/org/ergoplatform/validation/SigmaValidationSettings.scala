/**
  * Configuration of validation. Each `ValidationRule` instance should be
  * implemented as an `object` to facilitate type-safe usage. It then should be
  * registered in `ValidationRules.currentSettings` to be used in the code to
  * perform validation. Added to `currentSettings` the rule has EnabledRule
  * status by default, but only in a current version of the code. Thus, the
  * value `currentSettings` represents the validation settings of the current
  * version of the code. The set of rules in `currentSettings` is fixed in the
  * current version of the code and thus only rule status can be changed (as
  * described below)
  *
  * Old versions of the code don't have access to the rules added in newer
  * versions. The implementation of the specific rule, once released under
  * specific ruleId, should never be changed, hence ruleId denotes that
  * implementation. However, the behavior of rules (released with code) can be
  * altered by changing their status in block extensions section via voting.
  *
  * The status changes are represented in ValidationSettings using the
  * RuleStatus type. Each descendant class represent a particular change in the
  * rule status. Rule ids are used as keys of the status values stored in the
  * block extension section. RuleStatus instances are deserialized from the
  * block extension values. Deserialized (ruleId, status) pairs are joined with
  * the (ruleId,status) pairs in `currentSettings`, and for matching ruleIds the
  * default statues stored in `currentSettings` are replaced with the new
  * statuses obtained from the blockchain. Deserialized (ruleId,status) pairs
  * which don't match with `currentSettings` are ignored.
  *
  * Each rule has associated check of soft-fork condition by implementing
  * `isSoftFork` method. If `isSoftFork` returns true, then ValidationException
  * raised by the rule is interpreted as *soft-fork condition*. Depending on the
  * use case, soft-fork condition allows some operations performed by an old
  * code to succeed which otherwise would fail due to ValidationException raised
  * by the validation rule. One notable use case is Box.ergoTree validation in
  * which old code can skip ValidationExceptions under soft-fork condition (i.e.
  * when isSoftFork returns true), for example when a new opCode is added in the
  * newer version of the protocol, and this fact can be recognized by the old
  * code.
