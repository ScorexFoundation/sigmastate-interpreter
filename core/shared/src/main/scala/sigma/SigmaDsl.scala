    *   succeeds and returns `false`.
    * 2) If the register contains a value `v` of type `Int`.
    *   Then `val x = SELF.R4[Int]` succeeds and returns `Some(v)`, which is a valid value
    *   of type `Option[Int]`. In this case, calling `x.get` succeeds and returns the
    *   value `v` of type `Int`. Calling `x.isDefined` returns `true`.
    * 3) If the register contains a value `v` of type T other then `Int`.
    *   Then `val x = SELF.R4[Int]` fails, because there is no way to return a valid value
    *   of type `Option[Int]`. The value of register is present, so returning it as None
    *   would break the typed semantics of registers collection.
